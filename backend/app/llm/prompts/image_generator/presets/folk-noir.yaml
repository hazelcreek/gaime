# Noir infused with folklore, rural unease, and mythic residue

name: "Folk Noir"
description: "A noir aesthetic rooted in folklore, rural isolation, and ancestral memory. Familiar landscapes feel subtly wrong, heavy with ritual, history, and unspoken threat."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "uneasy, somber, ominous, introspective, quietly threatening"
  lighting: "naturalistic but uncanny, low sun, long shadows, overcast skies, candle or firelight contrasts"
  color_palette: "muted earth tones—lichen greens, peat browns, bone whites, weathered stone—with restrained warm highlights"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Folk noir cinematography blending grounded realism with folkloric unease.
  Landscapes appear ordinary but charged with ancestral memory: stone structures,
  coastal edges, rural courtyards, and weather-beaten environments shaped by ritual
  and labor. Color grading is desaturated and earthy, with subtle warmth introduced
  through firelight, lanterns, or interior glow. Composition favors stillness,
  symmetry that feels ritualistic, and slow observational framing. Weather—wind,
  mist, sea spray—acts as a living presence. Human absence or small figures suggest
  inherited guilt, unspoken tradition, and the persistence of the past beneath the
  present.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "third-person contemplative"
  shot: "wide or medium-wide shots, static framing"
  camera: "eye level, locked-off or slow drift, no handheld"
  effects: "fine film grain, subtle vignette, sea mist, smoke, drifting birds, organic motion"

# L6: Anti-styles (prevents style drift)
anti_styles:
  - "explicit fantasy creatures or magic"
  - "high-action or horror spectacle"
  - "urban neon environments"
  - "modern glossy realism"

# L6: Quality constraints
quality_constraints:
  - "watermarks or signatures"
  - "blurry or low-quality artifacts"
  - "distorted proportions"
  - "saturated or vivid colors"
  - "harsh digital sharpening"
