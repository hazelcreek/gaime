# Temperate noir aesthetic combining Nordic restraint with Scottish grit

name: "Scottish–Nordic Noir (Temperate)"
description: "A hybrid noir style blending Nordic minimalism with Scottish grit. Rain, wind, fog, and moral ambiguity in coastal and highland environments, without winter or snow."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "bleak, restrained, tense, morally ambiguous, quietly oppressive"
  lighting: "soft overcast daylight, low sun angles, directional breaks through cloud, practical light sources cutting through darkness"
  color_palette: "cool, desaturated earth tones—slate blues, moss greens, peat browns—with muted amber and sodium-vapor highlights"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Scottish–Nordic noir cinematography in a temperate climate. Desaturated,
  naturalistic color grading with low contrast blacks and lifted shadows.
  Landscapes feel indifferent yet historically burdened: rain-soaked roads,
  coastal cliffs, moorland, forests, and peripheral towns. Overcast skies dominate,
  with occasional directional light cutting through fog or rain. Composition favors
  negative space, off-center framing, and static or slow-moving camera work.
  Human figures appear small, isolated, and partially obscured by weather,
  architecture, or shadow. The style emphasizes restraint, texture, and atmosphere
  over spectacle, evoking modern Nordic noir fused with Scottish social realism.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "third-person observational"
  shot: "wide establishing shots, medium shots with heavy negative space"
  camera: "eye level or slightly elevated, minimal handheld, slow deliberate movement"
  effects: "light film grain, subtle vignette, rain streaks, wet surfaces, fog or sea mist, wind-driven motion"

# L6: Anti-styles (prevents style drift)
anti_styles:
  - "snow or winter imagery"

  - "bright or saturated colors"

# L6: Quality constraints
quality_constraints:
  - "watermarks or signatures"
  - "blurry or low-quality artifacts"
  - "distorted proportions"
