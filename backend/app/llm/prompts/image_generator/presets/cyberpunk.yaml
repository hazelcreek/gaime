# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "alienating, gritty, technologically oppressive, noir-influenced"
  lighting: "neon glow cutting through darkness, holographic displays, harsh artificial light, reflections on wet surfaces"
  color_palette: "dark base with vibrant neon accents - magenta, cyan, electric blue, toxic green against black and chrome"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Cinematic photorealism with cyberpunk aesthetic. High-quality rendering
  reminiscent of V-Ray or Unreal Engine cinematics. Detailed reflections on
  wet surfaces and chrome. Neon signs and holographic advertisements casting
  colored light. The visual quality should evoke high-budget sci-fi films.

technical:

  - "clean and sterile"

# L6: Quality constraints
quality_constraints:
  - "watermarks or signatures"
  - "blurry or low-quality artifacts"
