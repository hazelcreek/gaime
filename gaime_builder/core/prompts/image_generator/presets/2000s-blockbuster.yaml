# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "epic, heroic, intense, larger-than-life, dramatic"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Big budget Hollywood blockbuster cinematography from the 2000s superhero and
  action era. The larger-than-life visual language of films like The Dark Knight,
  Iron Man, Transformers, and 300. Dramatic teal-orange color grading that became
  the defining look of the era. Epic scale with dynamic camera angles—low angles
  making heroes monumental, dramatic wide shots establishing scope. Lens flares,
  volumetric lighting, and practical effects enhanced by digital polish. Everything
  feels heightened and cinematic. The visual style is paramount—this must feel
  like a frame from a $200 million action tentpole.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or dramatic third-person"
  shot: "epic wide establishing shots or dramatic low-angle hero shots"
  camera: "anamorphic widescreen, dynamic angles, crane and steadicam movement implied"
