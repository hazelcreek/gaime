# Warm, optimistic 80s/90s sci-fi television set design with LCARS, soft studio lighting, and practical realism.

name: "Star Trek: TNG (TV Show)"
description: "Aesthetic inspired by Star Trek: The Next Generation: warm, optimistic Federation interiors, LCARS displays, practical starship sets, and a calm cinematic TV-still feeling."

# L3: Mood - Emotional and atmospheric qualities
mood:
  tone: "optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical"
  lighting: "soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows"
  color_palette: "warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues"

# L4: Style - Artistic medium (MOST IMPORTANT LAYER)
style: |
  High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
  set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
  and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
  composed, and human — never grimdark. The visual style is paramount and must remain consistent across
  all locations in the world.

# L5: Technical - Composition and camera
technical:
  perspective: "first-person"
  shot: "medium wide shot"
  camera: "eye level"
  effects: "subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights"

# L6: Anti-styles - What to AVOID (prevents style drift)
anti_styles:
  - "cyberpunk neon dystopia"
  - "grimdark or horror lighting"
  - "hard industrial grime and rust"
  - "fantasy illustration"
  - "medieval or historical costumes"
  - "anime or manga"
  - "cartoon or caricature"
  - "high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look"
  - "modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)"

# L6: Quality constraints - Technical flaws to prevent
quality_constraints:
  - "watermarks or signatures"
  - "blurry or low-quality artifacts"
  - "distorted proportions"
  - "garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)"
  - "extra limbs or malformed hands"
  - "overly saturated neon colors"
