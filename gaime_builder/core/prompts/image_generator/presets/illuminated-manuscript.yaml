# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "sacred, mysterious, ornate, timeless, devotionally reverent"
  lighting: "flat medieval illumination with no cast shadows, gold leaf catching light with metallic gleam, the luminous quality of vellum under candlelight"
  color_palette: "rich medieval pigments—ultramarine blue, vermillion red, gold leaf, deep burgundy, forest green—bold saturated colors on cream vellum with black ink outlines"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Gothic illuminated manuscript art in the tradition of medieval monastic
  scriptoriums. Intricate decorative borders with intertwining vines, fantastical
  creatures, and geometric Celtic knotwork rendered in brilliant gold leaf and
  rich mineral pigments. Flat medieval perspective with no vanishing points—
  figures shown in stylized frontal or profile view with hierarchical scaling
  (important figures larger). Black ink outlines with precise calligraphic
  quality. Backgrounds of burnished gold or rich solid colors. Text areas
  featuring Gothic blackletter script or uncial calligraphy. Marginalia with
  grotesques, dragons, and whimsical creatures. The visual style is paramount—
  this must evoke authentic medieval manuscript illumination like the Book of
  Kells, Lindisfarne Gospels, or Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry.
