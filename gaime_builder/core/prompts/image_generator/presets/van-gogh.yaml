# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Post-impressionist oil painting faithfully recreating Vincent van Gogh's
  distinctive technique. Bold, visible brushstrokes with heavy impasto texture,
  following directional patterns that create movement and rhythm. Swirling,
  energetic strokes in skies and backgrounds. Thick application of paint that
  catches light. Colors are intensified and emotionally expressive rather than
  naturalistic. The visual style is paramount and must evoke Van Gogh's unique
  vision—where wheat fields ripple like waves, stars spiral with cosmic energy,
  and even simple interiors pulse with emotional intensity.
