# Italian Western film aesthetic inspired by Sergio Leone's iconic filmography

name: "Spaghetti Western"
description: "1960s Italian Western film aesthetic inspired by Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone, and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli. Sun-scorched landscapes, extreme contrasts, and operatic tension under the unforgiving desert sun."

# L3: Mood - The feel of Leone's Dollar Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West
mood:
  tone: "tense, operatic, sun-baked, morally ambiguous, stoic, fatalistic"
  lighting: "harsh midday sun casting deep black shadows, silhouettes against blazing sky, golden dust motes floating in shafts of light, dark interiors with slits of blinding daylight"
  color_palette: "sun-bleached earth tones, dusty ochre and sienna, burnt orange sunsets, weathered browns, occasional blood red, deep shadows approaching black, washed-out blues for distant sky"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT) - Defining the cinematic look
style: |
  Cinematic style faithfully recreating 1960s Italian Spaghetti Western films,
  specifically evoking Sergio Leone's visual language. Techniscope widescreen
  framing with extreme depth of field. Harsh desert lighting creates stark
  contrast between blinding sun and pitch-black shadows. Every surface is
  weathered, dusty, and sun-damaged - cracked wood, rusted metal, sweat-stained
  leather. Visible dust particles drift through sunbeams. Heat shimmer distorts
  distant horizons. Faces are lined, stubbled, sun-darkened. The visual style
  is paramount and must evoke the gritty authenticity of The Good, The Bad and
  The Ugly, For a Few Dollars More, and Once Upon a Time in the West.

# L5: Technical - Leone's distinctive cinematography
technical:
  perspective: "first-person"
  shot: "extreme wide establishing shots or dramatic medium close-ups emphasizing eyes"
  camera: "eye level or low angle looking up for dramatic tension, occasional extreme close-ups"
  effects: "film grain, dust particles suspended in air, heat haze on horizons, lens flare from harsh sun, slight color desaturation, vignette"

# L6: Anti-styles (critical for preventing drift from the period aesthetic)
anti_styles:
  - "modern or contemporary elements"
  - "lush green landscapes or vegetation"
  - "anime, cartoon, or stylized illustration"
  - "dark gothic or horror lighting"
  - "futuristic or science fiction"
  - "clean, polished, or pristine surfaces"
  - "rainy, wet, or overcast weather"
  - "bright saturated colors"
  - "soft romantic lighting"
  - "American Hollywood Western glamour"

# L6: Quality constraints
quality_constraints:
  - "watermarks or signatures"
  - "blurry or low-quality artifacts"
  - "anachronistic elements (cars, electricity, modern clothing)"
  - "green grass or lush vegetation"
  - "cold blue or purple lighting"
  - "pristine or new-looking objects"
  - "clean-shaven, well-groomed characters"
