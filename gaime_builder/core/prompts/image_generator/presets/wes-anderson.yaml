# Symmetrical compositions, pastel palettes - LIVE ACTION PHOTOGRAPHY, not animation

name: "Wes Anderson Cinematic"
description: "Wes Anderson's distinctive live-action cinematography. Obsessive symmetry, pastel palettes, and the visual precision of The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Royal Tenenbaums. Real actors, real sets, real locations."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "whimsical, melancholic, precise, nostalgic, deadpan"
  lighting: "soft cinematic lighting, warm tungsten practicals, diffused daylight, professional film set lighting"
  color_palette: "carefully curated pastel palette—dusty pinks, mustard yellows, mint greens, powder blues—with vintage Kodak film stock color science"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Live-action cinematic photography in the style of Wes Anderson's films like
  The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Royal Tenenbaums. This
  is REAL photography of REAL locations and sets with REAL people—not animation,
  not stop-motion, not miniatures, not claymation. Shot on 35mm Kodak film stock
  with anamorphic lenses. Perfect bilateral symmetry with the camera centered
  and perpendicular to walls. Full-scale production design with vintage props,
  patterned wallpaper, and coordinated color schemes. Real wood, real fabric,
  real paint—photographed with cinematic precision. Natural human scale with
  realistic proportions. The visual style is paramount—this must look like a
  frame from a live-action Wes Anderson film, photographed on a real film set.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "centered, perpendicular to main wall"
  shot: "symmetrical wide or medium shot"
  camera: "35mm anamorphic, locked tripod, perfectly level horizon"
  effects: "Kodak film grain, warm color grading, shallow depth of field on close-ups"
