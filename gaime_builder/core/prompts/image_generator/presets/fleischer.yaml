name: "Fleischer Studios"
description: "1930s Fleischer Studios rubber-hose animation style—the surreal, jazz-age world of Betty Boop, Popeye, and the rotoscoped Superman. Bouncy physics, pie-cut eyes, hand-inked outlines, and early Technicolor dreamscapes."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "surreal, playful, jazzy, slightly unsettling, vaudeville whimsy"
  lighting: "theatrical stage lighting with bold pools of light, expressionist shadows, occasional spotlights, the glow of 1930s nightclubs"
  color_palette: "early Technicolor palette—limited but bold primary colors, warm sepia undertones, cream whites, rich blacks, with that distinctive vintage film color cast"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  1930s Fleischer Studios rubber-hose animation style from the golden age of
  American cartoons. Characters with impossibly flexible, noodle-like limbs that
  stretch and squash with every movement. Pie-cut eyes (circular eyes with a
  wedge removed), white gloves on every character, and bouncy, musical physics
  where everything sways to an implied jazz rhythm. Hand-inked outlines with
  slight wobble suggesting frame-by-frame animation. Backgrounds painted in
  expressionist style with exaggerated perspectives and surreal impossible
  architecture. Early Technicolor process colors with film grain and slight
  registration errors. The visual style is paramount—this must capture the
  uncanny, dreamlike quality of Betty Boop's Minnie the Moocher or the
  Talkartoons era.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "theatrical side view or slight angle"
  shot: "medium shot framing full character"
  camera: "static frame with vaudeville staging"
  effects: "film grain, slight color bleeding, hand-painted cel texture, occasional film scratches"
