# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Spontaneous doodle art style as if sketched in a notebook margin or on scrap
  paper during a meeting. Hand-drawn aesthetic with visible pen strokes, slight
  line wobble, and the charming imperfection of casual sketching. Overlapping
  linework where ideas collide—characters and objects drawn at different scales,
  scattered across the composition. Cartoonish exaggeration with simplified
  features, expressive faces, and playful proportions. Filling every corner
  with small details, patterns, and decorative flourishes. The energy of pure
  creative flow without overthinking. Mix of fine pen details and bold marker
  strokes. The visual style is paramount—this must feel genuinely hand-drawn
  and spontaneous, not a polished illustration pretending to be casual.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "flat and graphic, ignoring traditional perspective"
  shot: "full composition with scattered elements"
