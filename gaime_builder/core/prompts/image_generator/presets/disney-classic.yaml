# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Disney Golden Age cel animation in the tradition of Snow White, Cinderella,
  and Sleeping Beauty. Hand-painted backgrounds with soft, impressionistic
  brushwork—enchanted forests with misty depth, castle interiors with warm
  candlelight glow. Character animation with graceful, fluid poses and big
  expressive eyes that convey deep emotion. Smooth color gradients achieved
  through careful airbrushing on cels. The distinctive Disney aesthetic of
  idealized beauty with realistic proportions but heightened expressiveness.
  Soft edges and gentle outlines rather than harsh black lines. Magical elements
  rendered with sparkling effects and luminous glows. The visual style is
  paramount—this must evoke authentic mid-century Disney animation, not modern
  CGI recreations or other animation styles.
