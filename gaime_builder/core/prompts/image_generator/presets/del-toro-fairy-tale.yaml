# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "enchanted, melancholic, romantic, mysterious, darkly beautiful"
  lighting: "rich amber candlelight and firelight, deep teal shadows, volumetric fog and dust, bioluminescent glows, dramatic chiaroscuro with soft edges"
  color_palette: "warm amber and gold against deep teal and forest green, jewel tones—ruby, emerald, sapphire—rich saturated shadows, vintage warmth with gothic depth"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Photorealistic dark fairy tale cinematography in the style of Guillermo del Toro's
  films—Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water, Crimson Peak, and The Devil's Backbone.
  This is REAL photography with lavish production design, not illustration or CGI.
  Every surface is tactile and weathered: crumbling stone, aged wood, rusted iron,
  velvet fabric, rain-slicked streets. Rich amber warmth from candles, fireplaces,
  and aged incandescent light contrasts with deep teal-green shadows. Gothic romanticism
  where darkness is beautiful, not terrifying. Magical elements feel ancient and organic—
  moss, roots, water, bone, gold leaf. Shot on film with vintage lenses creating soft
  edges and romantic bokeh. Composition favors symmetry and archetypal imagery. The
  mundane world brushes against the mythic. The visual style is paramount—this must
  feel like a frame from a del Toro film where fairy tales are real, beautiful, and
  touched with sorrow.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or intimate third-person"
  shot: "medium or medium-wide with architectural framing"
  camera: "35mm or 65mm film, gentle wide-angle, often low angles, symmetrical when mythic"
  effects: "soft film grain, amber-teal split toning, volumetric atmosphere, gentle lens bloom on lights, rich shadow detail"
