description: "Stop-motion clay animation aesthetic inspired by Aardman Animations. Tactile, handcrafted charm with visible fingerprints, plasticine textures, and that distinctive British whimsy of Wallace & Gromit."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "whimsical, cozy, handcrafted, charming, slightly absurd British humor"
  lighting: "warm and soft, studio-lit quality, gentle shadows that emphasize 3D depth, practical miniature lighting feel"
  color_palette: "warm earthy tones mixed with cheerful accents, muted but friendly colors, natural clay and plasticine hues"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Stop-motion clay animation style inspired by Aardman Animations (Wallace & Gromit,
  Chicken Run, Shaun the Sheep). Everything appears sculpted from plasticine and clay
  with visible tactile textures - you can almost see thumbprints and tool marks in the
  material. Characters have that distinctive bulging-eye, wide-mouth expressiveness.
  Environments are detailed miniature sets with handcrafted props. Slightly chunky,
  rounded forms with that characteristic clay weight and solidity. The aesthetic must
  feel like a physical stop-motion production - tangible, warm, and delightfully
  handmade. The visual style is paramount and must consistently evoke that tactile
  Aardman quality throughout.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or slightly elevated third-person"
  shot: "medium wide shot to appreciate the miniature set design"
  camera: "eye level or low angle to emphasize the physicality of the sets"
  effects: "subtle depth of field (miniature photography feel), warm practical lighting, visible textures on all surfaces"
