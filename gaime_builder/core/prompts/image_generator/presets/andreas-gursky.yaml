# Large-scale, pattern-rich, almost abstract documentary photography

name: "Andreas Gursky Photography"
description: "Large-scale contemporary photography in the style of Andreas Gursky. Elevated vantage points revealing patterns in human systems, overwhelming detail, and images that oscillate between documentary and abstract through sheer scale and repetition."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "overwhelming, systematic, detached, sublime, contemplative"
  lighting: "even, comprehensive, clinical clarity, no dramatic shadows obscuring detail"
  color_palette: "precise and controlled—often muted industrial tones or the specific colors of the subject matter (supermarket products, stock exchange screens, architecture)"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Large-scale photography in the tradition of Andreas Gursky and the Düsseldorf
  School. Elevated or distant vantage points that reveal patterns in human
  activity and built environments. Extraordinary resolution capturing
  overwhelming detail—every face in a crowd, every product on a shelf, every
  window in a building. The image oscillates between documentary record and
  abstract pattern. Scale is suggested through repetition and density. Digital
  compositing creates impossible comprehensive views. The photographic quality
  is paramount—this must feel like a museum-scale Gursky print where viewers
  can examine infinite detail.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "elevated, distant, or comprehensive viewpoint"
  shot: "wide or extreme wide, encompassing entire systems"
  camera: "large format digital, extreme resolution, deep focus throughout"
