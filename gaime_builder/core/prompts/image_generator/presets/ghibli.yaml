# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Studio Ghibli anime illustration in the painterly tradition of Hayao Miyazaki's
  films. Hand-painted cel animation aesthetic with visible watercolor texture in
  backgrounds. Lush, detailed natural environments with swaying grass, rustling
  leaves, and billowing clouds that feel alive. Characters with large expressive
  eyes conveying deep emotion, simple but graceful linework, and naturalistic
  proportions. Subtle magical realism where the extraordinary feels grounded and
  believable. Backgrounds painted with loving detail—every tree, stone, and flower
  rendered with care. The visual style is paramount—this must evoke the warmth
  and wonder of a genuine Ghibli film frame, not generic anime.

# L5: Technical

  perspective: "first-person or third-person cinematic"
