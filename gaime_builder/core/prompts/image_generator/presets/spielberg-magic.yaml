# L3: Mood
mood:

  color_palette: "warm amber and gold dominant, deep rich shadows with blue-purple tones, nostalgic Kodak film warmth, saturated but natural"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Cinematic magical realism in the style of 1980s Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment—
  E.T., Hook, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Goonies, and Legend. This is
  photorealistic cinematography that captures moments of transcendent wonder. Signature
  elements: subjects backlit by golden light creating glowing rim halos, lens flares
  from practical light sources, shafts of volumetric light cutting through darkness,
  warm amber tones contrasting cool shadows. Shot on 35mm film (Kodak 5247/5293) with
  vintage Panavision anamorphic lenses. The mundane world touched by magic—bicycles
  flying past the moon, light spilling from a closet, figures silhouetted against
  extraordinary light. Emotional and larger-than-life while remaining grounded in
  photographic reality. The visual style is paramount—this must evoke that specific
  80s blockbuster magic where anything seems possible.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or dramatic third-person"
  shot: "medium-wide establishing wonder, or intimate medium shots"
  camera: "35mm anamorphic Panavision, low angles looking up at wonder, sweeping movement implied"
  effects: "prominent lens flares, golden film grain, volumetric light, warm vignette, soft glow on highlights"
