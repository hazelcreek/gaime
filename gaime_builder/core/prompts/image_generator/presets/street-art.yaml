# Banksy-inspired stencil and wheat paste mural aesthetic

name: "Street Art"
description: "Contemporary street art aesthetic inspired by Banksy, Shepard Fairey, and urban mural culture. Stencil work, wheat paste posters, spray paint texture, and the raw energy of unsanctioned public art on weathered urban surfaces."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "subversive, raw, urgent, provocative, underground"
  lighting: "flat and graphic for stencil elements, natural urban daylight on wall surfaces"
  color_palette: "limited palette—often black and white with one or two accent colors (red, yellow, cyan), or the faded tones of weathered posters and paint"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Street art aesthetic combining stencil graffiti, wheat paste posters, and
  spray paint murals. Banksy-inspired stencil work with crisp graphic edges
  and ironic juxtapositions. Visible on weathered urban surfaces—crumbling
  brick, concrete, metal shutters, peeling paint. The texture of the street
  is essential: drips, overspray, layers of older tags and posters showing
  through. Work appears site-specific and ephemeral. The visual style is
  paramount—this must feel like authentic street art discovered in an alley
  or on an abandoned building, not sanitized gallery work.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person, as if encountering the art on a wall"
  shot: "medium shot showing both artwork and urban context"
  camera: "eye level, straight-on or slight angle"
  effects: "spray paint texture, stencil edges, drips and runs, weathered wall surface, peeling layers"
