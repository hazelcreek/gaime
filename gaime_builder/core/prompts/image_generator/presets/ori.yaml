# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Luminous hand-painted illustration in the style of Moon Studios' Ori games.
  Lush, layered environments with incredible depth created through atmospheric
  perspective and parallax layers. Soft, painterly brushwork with visible
  texture in backgrounds. Characters as small glowing spirits emitting soft
  light halos against vast, detailed environments. Magical elements rendered
  with bloom effects and particle systems. The interplay of light and shadow
  creating emotional resonance—shafts of golden sunlight, bioluminescent
  plants, glowing spirit wisps. Nature rendered with loving detail: moss,
  bark texture, falling leaves, flowing water. The visual style is paramount—
  this must capture the breathtaking beauty and emotional depth of Ori's world.
