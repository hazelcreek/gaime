# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Modern adult animated sitcom style combining elements from shows like Rick and Morty,
  BoJack Horseman, Archer, and Bob's Burgers. Clean vector-style linework with
  consistent line weights. Flat, solid color fills with minimal gradients or shading.
  Characters have stylized proportions - not quite realistic, not quite cartoon,
  occupying that distinctive adult animation middle ground. Simplified but recognizable
  backgrounds with just enough detail to establish setting. The aesthetic should feel
  like a frame from a premium cable or streaming adult animated series - polished,
  intentionally styled, with that knowing visual sophistication. The visual style must
  consistently maintain that adult animation look throughout.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or standard TV animation framing"
  shot: "medium to medium-wide, typical sitcom staging"
