name: "1920s Large Format Photography"
description: "Early 20th century large format photography aesthetic inspired by Edward Weston, Alfred Stieglitz, and the f/64 Group. Extraordinary tonal range, sharp focus throughout, and the contemplative stillness of 8x10 view camera work."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "contemplative, still, formal, dignified, timeless"
  lighting: "natural light carefully observed, soft window light for interiors, golden hour or overcast for outdoors, gentle gradations without harsh contrast"
  color_palette: "monochromatic—full tonal range from deep blacks through subtle mid-grays to luminous whites, with the warm tone of vintage silver gelatin prints"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Vintage large format photography from the 1920s era, evoking the work of
  Edward Weston, Alfred Stieglitz, and Paul Strand. Shot on 8x10 view camera
  with extraordinary depth of field—sharp from foreground to infinity. Rich
  silver gelatin print tonality with smooth gradations across the full tonal
  range. Formal, considered composition with subjects rendered with stillness
  and weight. Warm sepia or platinum print toning. The photographic quality
  is paramount—this must feel like a museum-quality vintage print from the
  early modernist photography movement.

# L5: Technical
