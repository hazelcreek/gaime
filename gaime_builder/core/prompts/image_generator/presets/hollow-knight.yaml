# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Hand-drawn 2D illustration in the style of Team Cherry's Hollow Knight.
  Delicate, precise linework with consistent weight creating elegant character
  silhouettes. Muted, melancholic color palette dominated by cool blues and
  greys with strategic warm accents. Characters rendered as stylized insects
  and creatures with mask-like faces and flowing cloaks. Environments featuring
  vast cavernous spaces, ancient ruins, organic architecture blending with
  crystal and stone. Subtle animation-ready poses with clear readable
  silhouettes. The visual style is paramount—this must capture the specific
  hand-crafted beauty and somber atmosphere of Hallownest, not generic
  fantasy or other indie game aesthetics.

technical:
  perspective: "side-scrolling 2D, occasional depth layers"
