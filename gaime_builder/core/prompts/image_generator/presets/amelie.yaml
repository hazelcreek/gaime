# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "magical, nostalgic, whimsical, warm, dreamlike yet grounded"
  lighting: "warm golden diffused light, soft shadows, magical practicals, glowing warm interiors against cool exteriors, lens flares from light sources"
  color_palette: "rich saturated greens and golden ambers, warm skin tones, desaturated blues and grays for contrast, vintage Kodak warmth pushed to eleven"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Photorealistic magical realism in the cinematic style of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films,
  particularly Amélie, City of Lost Children, and A Very Long Engagement. This is REAL
  photography of REAL locations—not illustration, not CGI—but with reality heightened
  to feel like a living fairy tale. Hyper-saturated color grading with rich greens,
  warm ambers, and golden skin tones. Every texture is tactile and inviting—worn wood,
  aged brass, peeling paint, faded fabric. Soft diffused lighting creates a dreamlike
  glow while maintaining photographic detail. The mundane becomes magical through
  composition and color. Shot on 35mm film with vintage anamorphic lenses for subtle
  flares and organic bokeh. The visual style is paramount—this must feel like a frame
  from Amélie, where ordinary life becomes extraordinary through cinematic alchemy.

# L5: Technical

  perspective: "first-person or intimate third-person"
