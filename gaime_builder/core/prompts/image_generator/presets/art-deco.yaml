# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Art Deco illustration and poster art from the 1920s-1930s era. Bold geometric
  patterns: sunburst rays, chevron zigzags, stepped pyramidal forms, stylized
  fountains, and fan motifs. Clean hard edges with no soft gradients—shapes are
  precise and architectural. Influenced by Egyptian revival, Aztec geometry, and
  machine-age streamlining. Evokes the Chrysler Building, Tamara de Lempicka
  paintings, and Erté fashion illustrations. Polished surfaces: chrome, lacquer,
  inlaid marble, and gilded ornament. The visual style is paramount—every element
  must feel like it belongs in a glamorous Jazz Age speakeasy or luxury ocean liner.
