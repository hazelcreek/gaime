name: "LEGO"
description: "LEGO brick construction aesthetic with plastic minifigures, modular brick environments, and that distinctive toy-world charm. Perfect for playful, creative, or family-friendly adventures."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "playful, creative, imaginative, family-friendly, toy-world wonder"
  lighting: "bright and cheerful, clean studio-like lighting, subtle plastic reflections, warm and inviting"
  color_palette: "bold primary LEGO colors, saturated plastic hues, classic red/blue/yellow/green bricks, shiny ABS plastic finish"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  LEGO brick construction aesthetic where everything is built from plastic LEGO bricks
  and elements. Environments are modular brick constructions with visible studs, plates,
  and specialized pieces. Characters are classic LEGO minifigures with cylindrical heads,
  C-shaped hands, and that distinctive blocky body shape. All surfaces have that shiny
  ABS plastic quality with subtle reflections. The world should feel like a massive
  LEGO set come to life - creative, colorful, and unmistakably brick-built. Props and
  details use recognizable LEGO elements (tiles, slopes, technic pieces). The visual
  style must consistently maintain that authentic LEGO toy aesthetic throughout,
  as if photographed or rendered from a real LEGO diorama.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or slightly elevated third-person"
  shot: "medium wide to appreciate the brick construction"
  camera: "eye level or low angle (toy's-eye view)"
  effects: "subtle plastic reflections, depth of field for miniature feel, clean studio lighting, visible brick studs"
