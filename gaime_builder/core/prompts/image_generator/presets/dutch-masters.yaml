# Classic Rembrandt and Vermeer aesthetic with dramatic chiaroscuro and rich textures

name: "Dutch Masters"
description: "Dutch Golden Age oil painting aesthetic inspired by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Frans Hals. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, rich oil textures, and the warm glow of candlelit interiors."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "contemplative, intimate, dignified, quietly dramatic"
  lighting: "dramatic chiaroscuro, single light source from window or candle, deep shadows with luminous highlights, soft golden glow on skin and fabrics"
  color_palette: "warm earth tones—burnt umber, raw sienna, ochre—with deep blacks, creamy whites, and occasional rich vermillion or ultramarine accents"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Classical Dutch Golden Age oil painting in the tradition of Rembrandt van Rijn
  and Johannes Vermeer. Rich impasto brushwork visible in highlights, with smooth
  glazed shadows creating depth. Dramatic tenebrism where figures emerge from
  darkness into pools of warm light. Surfaces show the tactile quality of oil
  paint—the sheen of silk, the weight of velvet, the gleam of metal and glass.
  The visual style is paramount and must evoke authentic 17th-century Dutch
  masterwork painting with museum-quality technique.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person"
  shot: "medium shot or medium close-up"
  camera: "eye level, intimate framing"
  effects: "visible brushwork, canvas texture, varnished surface quality, subtle craquelure"
