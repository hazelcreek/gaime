# Sepia ink sketches, anatomical precision, sfumato, and genius marginalia

name: "Da Vinci Codex"
description: "Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance drawing aesthetic—sepia ink on aged parchment, anatomical precision, sfumato shading, mirror-script annotations, and the restless curiosity of a polymath's notebook."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "intellectual, curious, secretive, timeless, contemplative"
  lighting: "soft diffused illumination as if from a window onto a desk, subtle shadows suggesting three-dimensional form through hatching"
  color_palette: "sepia, burnt sienna, raw umber, cream parchment tones—monochromatic warmth with occasional red chalk and sanguine accents"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Renaissance master drawing in the distinctive style of Leonardo da Vinci's
  notebooks and studies. Fine quill pen work in sepia ink on aged cream parchment.
  Cross-hatching and parallel hatching to build form and shadow with extraordinary
  precision. Sfumato technique in shaded areas creating soft, smoke-like transitions.
  Anatomical accuracy reflecting deep observational study. The aesthetic of the
  Codex Leicester and Vitruvian Man studies—scientific rigor married to artistic
  beauty. Margins may contain mirror-script annotations, geometric diagrams, and
  exploratory sketches. The visual style is paramount—this must evoke an authentic
  Renaissance master's working drawing, not a finished painting.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or study view"
  shot: "medium shot or detailed study"
  camera: "eye level, as if examining a page on a desk"
