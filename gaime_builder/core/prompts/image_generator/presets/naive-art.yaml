# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Naïve art painting in the tradition of Henri Rousseau and Grandma Moses.
  Deliberately flattened perspective where objects appear stacked rather than
  receding naturally. Bold outlines define forms clearly. Decorative patterning
  in foliage, textiles, and architectural details. Proportions follow emotional
  rather than anatomical logic. Every leaf, every blade of grass rendered with
  equal attention. The visual style is paramount—it must feel handmade, sincere,
  and untrained yet deeply intentional, like a treasured folk painting.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "flattened, stacked planes with minimal depth recession"
  shot: "wide or medium wide shot showing full scene"
