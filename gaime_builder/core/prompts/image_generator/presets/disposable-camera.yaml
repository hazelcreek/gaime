name: "Disposable Camera"
description: "Lo-fi disposable camera aesthetic—the casual charm of Fujifilm QuickSnap and Kodak FunSaver. Harsh direct flash, slightly washed colors, date stamps, and the beautiful imperfection of point-and-shoot memories."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "casual, nostalgic, candid, imperfect, intimate"
  lighting: "harsh direct flash creating flat frontal lighting with red-eye potential, dark backgrounds falling off to black, occasional lens flare from light sources"
  color_palette: "slightly washed and desaturated, warm color cast from cheap optics, muted highlights, crushed shadows, that distinctive disposable camera color science"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Lo-fi disposable camera photography in the style of Fujifilm QuickSnap or
  Kodak FunSaver single-use cameras. Harsh built-in flash creating flat,
  unflattering but charming frontal lighting. Fixed-focus plastic lens creating
  soft edges and slight blur, especially in corners. The distinctive look of
  cheap 35mm film—visible grain, limited dynamic range, and that particular
  color cast. Casual, snapshot composition as if taken quickly at a party or
  on vacation. Red date stamp in the corner reading a plausible date. The
  visual style is paramount—this must feel like an authentic snapshot from
  a disposable camera, not professional photography made to look amateur.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "snapshot eye-level, often slightly off-center"
  shot: "casual medium shot or group shot"
  camera: "fixed 32mm plastic lens, f/10, 1m to infinity focus"
