# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Jim Henson Muppet aesthetic where everything appears to be made of felt, fabric,
  fur, and foam rubber. The world looks like a theatrical puppet production with
  visible textures - fuzzy felt surfaces, googly eyes, stitched seams, and foam
  puppet construction. Environments are theatrical sets with painted backdrops,
  practical props, and stage curtains. Characters have that distinctive Muppet
  look - expressive fabric faces with wide mouths, ping-pong ball eyes, and
  wild yarn or feather hair. Everything feels handcrafted and tactile, like a
  loving Jim Henson production. The visual style must consistently maintain that
  puppet-show magic where inanimate materials come alive with personality.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or theatrical proscenium view"
  shot: "medium to medium-wide to capture puppet staging"
  camera: "eye level or slightly low (as if viewing a puppet stage)"
