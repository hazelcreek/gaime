# Black-and-white inked manga look with screentones and strong linework

name: "Monochromatic Manga"
description: "Black-and-white manga illustration: crisp ink linework, high contrast lighting, and screentone shading. Ideal for noir, drama, horror, or punchy action panels."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "graphic, dramatic, cinematic, high-contrast"
  lighting: "strong directional lighting, deep blacks and sharp highlights; readable shapes in monochrome"
  color_palette: "strictly black, white, and gray screentones (no color hues)"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Monochromatic Japanese manga illustration in black and white. Crisp inked
  line art with confident contours and deliberate line weight variation.
  Use screentone/halftone shading, cross-hatching, and solid black fills for
  contrast. The image must read like a printed manga panel: high contrast,
  clear silhouettes, and expressive faces. Absolutely no color rendering—
  only black, white, and gray screentones. The visual style is paramount and
  must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or close third-person"
  shot: "medium wide shot (panel-like framing) with occasional dramatic close-up emphasis"
  camera: "eye level with occasional low angle for intensity"
  effects: "screentone gradients, halftone dots, speed lines for motion, subtle ink splatter optional"

# L6: Anti-styles (prevents style drift)
anti_styles:
  - "full color illustration"
