# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Photographic image that feels like a still frame from a 1980s American
  multi-camera sitcom shot on videotape. Bright, flat studio lighting with
  soft shadows. Three-wall sets with the distinctive look of 80s production
  design—wood paneling, patterned wallpaper, overstuffed furniture, practical
  lamps providing warm accent light. The image should feel cozy, lived-in, and
  slightly overlit in the characteristic sitcom style. Shot on broadcast video
  with that distinctive 80s television quality—warm, slightly soft, and homey.
  The visual style is paramount and must evoke the comfort-food nostalgia of
  classic 80s family sitcoms.
