style: |
  Revolutionary comic book animation style from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
  Every frame designed to look like a living comic book panel. Ben-Day halftone
  dots visible in shadows and gradients, giving a printed comic texture.
  Chromatic aberration and RGB color fringing around edges creating depth and
  energy. Mixed media approach—painted textures, ink splatters, hand-drawn
  speed lines, onomatopoeia text integrated into scenes. Variable frame rates
  suggested through motion blur choices. Bold graphic compositions with strong
  silhouettes. Kirby Krackle energy effects for powers. The visual style is
  paramount—this must capture the specific groundbreaking aesthetic that makes
  Spider-Verse look unlike any other animation.
