# Bold graphic style inspired by Warhol, Lichtenstein, and the 1960s movement

name: "Pop Art"
description: "Bold Pop Art aesthetic inspired by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and the 1960s art movement. Flat graphic shapes, Ben-Day dots, bold outlines, and vibrant commercial colors that blur the line between high art and mass culture."

# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "bold, ironic, energetic, commercial, iconic"
  lighting: "flat and even, no naturalistic shadows, graphic rather than realistic"
  color_palette: "vibrant, saturated primary and secondary colors—hot pink, electric yellow, cyan, bold red—often in unexpected combinations with black outlines"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Pop Art illustration in the tradition of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
  Bold, flat areas of saturated color with strong black outlines. Ben-Day dots
  for shading and texture, evoking commercial printing. Graphic, poster-like
  composition with iconic, simplified forms. The aesthetic of comic books,
  advertising, and mass media elevated to fine art. Colors are artificial and
  electric rather than naturalistic. The visual style is paramount—this must
  feel like a gallery-worthy Pop Art piece from the 1960s movement.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or flat graphic"
  shot: "medium shot or close-up for iconic framing"
