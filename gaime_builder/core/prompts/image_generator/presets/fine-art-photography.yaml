# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Classic black and white fine art photography in the tradition of Ansel Adams
  and the f/64 Group. Zone System tonal mastery with rich blacks, pure whites,
  and extraordinary tonal separation in mid-grays. Pristine sharpness from
  foreground to infinity using large format depth of field. Clean, deliberate
  composition with strong geometric structure. The image captures light as a
  transformative force—revealing texture in stone, drama in clouds, luminosity
  in water. Silver gelatin print quality with subtle tonal gradations. The
  photographic quality is paramount—this must feel like a museum-quality fine
  art print from a master of the medium.

  perspective: "first-person"
