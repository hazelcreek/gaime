  Editorial caricature illustration in the tradition of Tom Richmond, Mort
  Drucker, and MAD Magazine artists. Masterful exaggeration of distinctive
  features—large heads with emphasized defining characteristics, expressive
  hands, dynamic body language. Confident, fluid linework with varied line
  weight. Rich color applied with illustrative skill, not flat but modeled
  with purpose. Backgrounds can be detailed or simplified for focus. Characters
  feel alive and caught mid-expression. The visual style is paramount—this
  must feel like professional editorial illustration from a master caricaturist,
  not amateur cartoon.
