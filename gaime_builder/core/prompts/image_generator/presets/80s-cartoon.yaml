# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Classic 1980s American animation style in the tradition of Warner Bros Looney Tunes
  and Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Hand-drawn aesthetic with bold, confident black outlines
  of varying thickness. Cel animation look with flat, solid color fills for characters
  and objects. Backgrounds are painted in a looser, more impressionistic watercolor
  style - soft, textured, and slightly muted compared to the vibrant foreground elements.
  Exaggerated squash-and-stretch proportions implied even in still images. Characters
  and objects have that classic "rubber hose" flexibility. The visual style absolutely
  must capture the nostalgic charm of Saturday morning cartoons from the 1980s.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or theatrical side-view"
  shot: "medium wide shot to capture environmental gags and staging"
  camera: "eye level or dynamic angles for comedic effect"
  effects: "speed lines implied, motion blur on fast elements, dust clouds, classic cartoon expressions"
