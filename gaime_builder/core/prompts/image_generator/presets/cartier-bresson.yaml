# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Black and white street photography in the tradition of Henri Cartier-Bresson
  and Magnum Photos. The decisive moment—geometry, gesture, and timing aligned
  in a single frame. Shot with a 35mm rangefinder camera, candid and unposed.
  Strong geometric composition with leading lines, shadows, and architectural
  framing. Human subjects caught in authentic moments of life. Available light
  only, never flash. The image should feel both spontaneous and perfectly
  composed, as if fate and photographer's eye aligned. The visual style is
  paramount—this must evoke the humanist poetry of classic French street
  photography.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person, eye-level street view"
  shot: "candid medium shot or environmental portrait"
  camera: "35mm rangefinder, zone focusing, moderate depth of field"
