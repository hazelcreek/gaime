# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Tim Burton's distinctive gothic visual style combining German Expressionism
  with whimsical darkness. Characters with impossibly thin, elongated limbs
  and exaggerated features—large hollow eyes, spindly fingers, hunched
  postures. Architecture featuring impossible angles, crooked spires, and
  spiral motifs. Stark tonal contrasts with pale figures against dark
  backgrounds. The aesthetic of Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and
  The Nightmare Before Christmas—simultaneously creepy and endearing.
  Recurring visual motifs: spirals, stripes, stitches, bare twisted trees,
  iron gates, Victorian decay. The visual style is paramount—this must
  capture Burton's unique marriage of the macabre and the tender.
