# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Franco-Belgian bande dessinée comic book style in the tradition of Asterix (Uderzo
  and Goscinny), Tintin (Hergé's ligne claire), and Lucky Luke. Clean, confident ink
  linework with consistent line weights - the classic European clear line style.
  Flat, vibrant colors without gradients, applied within bold outlines. Expressive
  character designs with exaggerated features - big noses, distinctive silhouettes,
  comedic proportions. Detailed yet stylized backgrounds with architectural precision.
  Panel-ready compositions that feel like frames from a classic European comic album.
  The visual style must consistently capture that beloved Franco-Belgian comic aesthetic
  throughout the entire image.
