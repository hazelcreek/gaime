# L3: Mood
mood:
  tone: "heartfelt, adventurous, emotionally rich, family-friendly wonder"

  color_palette: "rich and saturated, carefully art-directed color schemes, strong color storytelling, vibrant but harmonious"

# L4: Style (MOST IMPORTANT)
style: |
  Modern 3D animated movie style in the tradition of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios.
  High-quality CGI rendering with that distinctive stylized realism - not photorealistic,
  but beautifully rendered with subsurface scattering on skin, detailed textures, and
  gorgeous lighting. Characters have appealing, slightly caricatured proportions with
  large expressive eyes and readable silhouettes. Environments are richly detailed with
  a painterly quality to textures and careful art direction. Everything feels like a
  frame from a major animated feature film - polished, emotionally resonant, and
  visually stunning. The visual style must consistently achieve that Pixar-quality
  3D animation look throughout the entire image.

# L5: Technical
technical:
  perspective: "first-person or cinematic third-person"
  shot: "medium wide establishing shot or dramatic close-up as scene demands"
  camera: "dynamic cinematic angles, shallow depth of field for focus"
  effects: "subsurface scattering, ambient occlusion, volumetric lighting, subtle lens effects"
