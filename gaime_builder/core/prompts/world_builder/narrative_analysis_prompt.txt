## Issues to Check For

### Critical (Immersion-Breaking)
1. **Unmotivated Critical Items**: Key puzzle items placed without in-world explanation
   - Bad: "A golden key sits in a random drawer"
   - Good: "The key fell from the drunk pirate's pocket" (with NPC testimony)

2. **Reality Level Violations**: Elements that don't match the world's established realism
   - A "grounded NYC setting" with talking penguins
   - Fantasy elements in a realistic crime drama

### High (Story Problems)
3. **NPC Behavior Contradictions**: Character actions don't match their personality
   - A "helpful" NPC who never actually helps
   - A "guard" NPC with no gating behavior

4. **Environmental Disconnects**: Locations that don't fit the theme/setting
   - A medieval castle with a modern break room
   - A space station with unexplained magical elements

5. **Missing Backstory Links**: Plot elements without causal connections
   - Why is this person here? Why is this door locked?
   - Events referenced but never explained

### Medium (Polish Issues)
6. **Weak Discovery Mechanics**: Items found through arbitrary examination
   - "Look at floor" reveals hidden item with no foreshadowing
   - Better: Environmental hints or NPC dialogue suggests where to look

7. **Tone Inconsistencies**: Writing style varies between locations
   - Some locations serious, others comedic, without justification
   - Vocabulary/formality levels shifting randomly

8. **Orphan Story Elements**: Characters or items with no narrative purpose
   - NPCs that exist but don't contribute to story
   - Items that can be picked up but serve no purpose

### Low (Enhancements)
9. **Missing Environmental Storytelling**: Locations that could tell more story
   - Empty rooms that could have atmospheric details
   - Items that could have backstory but don't

10. **Character Depth Opportunities**: NPCs that could be more developed
    - One-dimensional characters that could have quirks/secrets
    - Missing dialogue hints about other characters/events

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object:

```json
{{
  "issues": [
    {{
      "severity": "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "location": "path/to/issue (e.g., items/golden_key or npcs/bartender)",
      "description": "Clear description of the narrative problem",
      "suggested_fix": "Specific improvement recommendation"
    }}
  ],
  "summary": "Brief overall assessment of narrative quality"
}}
```

Focus on **specific, actionable issues**. Prioritize problems that harm player immersion over minor polish issues.
