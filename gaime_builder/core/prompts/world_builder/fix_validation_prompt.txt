The world you generated has validation errors. Fix the YAML to resolve them.

## Validation Errors
{validation_errors}

## Current Content

### world.yaml
```yaml
{world_yaml}
```

### locations.yaml
```yaml
{locations_yaml}
```

### npcs.yaml
```yaml
{npcs_yaml}
```

### items.yaml
```yaml
{items_yaml}
```

## Common Fixes

1. **"Flag 'X' is checked but never set"**
   - Add an interaction with `sets_flag: X` to a location
   - Example: If victory requires `killer_confronted`, add:
     ```yaml
     interactions:
       confront:
         triggers: ["confront killer", "accuse"]
         narrative_hint: "You present the evidence..."
         sets_flag: killer_confronted
     ```

2. **"Exit points to invalid location 'X'"**
   - Either fix the exit to reference an existing location, or add the missing location

3. **"Item 'X' has invalid location"**
   - Fix the item's location to match a defined location_id

4. **"NPC 'X' has invalid location"**
   - Fix the NPC's location to match a defined location_id

5. **"Victory location 'X' is invalid"**
   - Fix victory.location in world.yaml to match a defined location_id

6. **"Victory item 'X' is invalid"**
   - Fix victory.item in world.yaml to match a defined item_id, or add the missing item

## Output
Return the fixed YAML files as JSON. Include ONLY the files that need changes:

```json
{{
  "world_yaml": "...",
  "locations_yaml": "...",
  "npcs_yaml": "...",
  "items_yaml": "..."
}}
```

CRITICAL:
- Use standard JSON escaping: \n for newlines, \" for quotes
- Ensure all YAML is valid when parsed
- Only return fields that needed fixes (you can omit unchanged files)
