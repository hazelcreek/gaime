You are synthesizing the detailed YAML for a text adventure world based on the approved design brief.

## Design Brief (from Pass 1)
{design_brief}

## Requirements
- Theme: {theme}
- Number of locations: {num_locations}
- Number of NPCs: {num_npcs}

## User's Original Description
{prompt}

## Your Task
Implement the design brief as detailed YAML. Every puzzle thread, gate, secret, and constraint from the brief MUST be reflected in the YAML.

## Output Format
You MUST respond with valid JSON containing four YAML strings. Follow this EXACT structure:

```json
{{
  "world_id": "{world_id}",
  "world_yaml": "name: \\"World Name\\"\\ntheme: \\"theme here\\"\\ntone: \\"tone here\\"\\nhero_name: \\"Protagonist Name\\"\\n\\npremise: |\\n  Description of the world premise...\\n\\nstarting_situation: |\\n  Describe WHY the player can act NOW. What event, opportunity, or change has occurred that enables the adventure to begin? This is crucial for immersion.\\n\\nvictory:\\n  location: final_location_id\\n  item: optional_required_item\\n  flag: optional_required_flag\\n  narrative: |\\n    The ending narrative when the player wins...\\n\\nplayer:\\n  starting_location: first_location_id\\n  starting_inventory:\\n    - item_id\\n\\nconstraints:\\n  - \\"Constraint 1\\"\\n  - \\"Constraint 2\\"\\n\\ncommands:\\n  help: \\"Display available commands\\"\\n  look: \\"Examine surroundings\\"\\n  inventory: \\"Check inventory\\"\\n  go: \\"Move in a direction\\"",
  "locations_yaml": "location_id:\\n  name: \\"Location Name\\"\\n  atmosphere: |\\n    Atmospheric description that establishes WHERE the player is...\\n  exits:\\n    north: other_location_id\\n  items:\\n    - item_id\\n  item_placements:\\n    item_id: \\"WHERE in this room the item is located\\"\\n  npcs:\\n    - npc_id\\n  npc_placements:\\n    npc_id: \\"WHERE in this room the NPC is positioned\\"\\n  details:\\n    thing: \\"Description of examinable thing\\"\\n    north: \\"Narrative description of what the north exit looks like\\"\\n  interactions:\\n    interaction_id:\\n      triggers:\\n        - \\"examine thing\\"\\n      narrative_hint: \\"What happens when triggered\\"\\n      sets_flag: flag_name\\n      reveals_exit: hidden_location_id\\n  requires:\\n    flag: required_flag_name",
  "npcs_yaml": "npc_id:\\n  name: \\"NPC Name\\"\\n  role: \\"Their role\\"\\n  location: location_id\\n  appearance: |\\n    Physical description of the character.\\n  personality:\\n    traits:\\n      - \\"trait_one\\"\\n      - \\"trait_two\\"\\n    speech_style: \\"How they speak\\"\\n    quirks:\\n      - \\"Behavioral quirk\\"\\n  knowledge:\\n    - \\"Something they know\\"\\n  dialogue_rules:\\n    - \\"Rule for how they communicate\\"",
  "items_yaml": "item_id:\\n  name: \\"Item Name\\"\\n  portable: true\\n  examine: |\\n    Description when examined...\\n  found_description: \\"REQUIRED: How the item appears naturally in the room scene.\\"\\n  take_description: \\"Message when taken\\""
}}
```

## Implementing the Design Brief

### Puzzle Threads
For each puzzle thread in the design brief:
- Create the locations involved
- Add items that unlock progress
- Add interactions that set flags or reveal exits
- Ensure the steps are achievable in sequence

### Gate Types Implementation
- **Hidden exits**: Use `reveals_exit` in an interaction, with `requires.flag` on the destination
- **Locked exits**: Use `requires.item` on the destination location
- **Sequence gates**: Use `requires.flag` that gets set by an earlier action

### Navigation Loop
Implement the shortcut described in the brief:
- Initially hidden or locked
- Unlocked by the specified action/item
- Connects the specified locations

### Optional Secrets
For each secret:
- Create the hidden content (room, item, lore)
- Add subtle hints in nearby locations
- Make discovery feel rewarding but not required

## CRITICAL RULES FOR JSON OUTPUT
1. The output must be valid JSON that can be parsed by Python's json.loads()
2. For YAML strings inside JSON: use \n for newlines and \" for quotes (standard JSON escaping)
3. Use | for multi-line YAML text blocks
4. Ensure all location exits reference valid location IDs
5. Ensure player starting_location matches a defined location
6. Ensure player starting_inventory items are defined in items_yaml
7. Each YAML string must be valid YAML when the JSON is parsed

IMPORTANT: Do NOT double-escape. Use standard JSON escaping only:
- Newlines: \n (not \\n)
- Quotes: \" (not \\")
- Backslashes: \\ (only when you want a literal backslash)

## CRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
1. Every exit MUST have narrative justification in the atmosphere or details
2. The starting_situation MUST explain WHY the player can begin acting NOW
3. Every item MUST have a found_description that naturally integrates into scene description
4. The victory condition must match what's specified in the design brief
5. The starting location must make narrative sense
6. Exits should feel realistic - don't have open passages where there should be locked doors
7. Every item in a location MUST have an item_placements entry
8. Every NPC in a location MUST have an npc_placements entry
9. Constraints must include the key_constraints from the design brief

## Guidelines
- Use snake_case for all IDs (e.g., dark_forest, old_hermit, rusty_key)
- Make locations interconnected (exits should match bidirectionally where appropriate)
- Give NPCs distinct personalities and useful knowledge
- Add rich atmosphere descriptions for immersion
- Give the protagonist a fitting name (hero_name) that NPCs can use in dialogue
- Hidden exits should NOT appear in the exits list until revealed via interaction
