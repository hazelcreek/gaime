# GAIME Documentation

Welcome to the GAIME docs site. It brings together the key developer docs in `docs/`, concept notes from `ideas/`, and the repository README in one searchable, navigable site.

## What you'll find

- **Project Docs**: Architecture, API reference, world authoring guide, and LLM integration details that power the engine.
- **Ideas**: Exploratory notes and future directions for the platform.
- **Repository README**: Quick start and project overview.

Use the left navigation or the search box to jump to any topic. For local preview, install the docs dependencies and run `mkdocs serve`.
