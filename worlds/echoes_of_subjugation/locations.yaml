cell_block_c:
  name: "Cell Block C"
  atmosphere: |
    The air smells of ozone and unwashed bodies. Hexagonal energy barriers hum with a headache-inducing frequency, serving as cell doors. The concrete floor is cold and stained with decades of grime.

mess_hall:
  name: "Nutrient Dispensary"
  atmosphere: |
    A cavernous room lit by flickering halogen strips. Rows of metal tables are bolted to the floor. A large screen on the wall plays endless propaganda about the Protectors' mercy. The dispensing machines grind loudly.

kitchen_scullery:
  name: "Scullery"
  atmosphere: |
    Steaming vents hiss constantly. The room is filled with industrial dishwashers and waste chutes. It's surprisingly unguarded, considered too filthy for the Protectors to patrol often.

courtyard_access:
  name: "Courtyard Airlock"

    A heavy blast door separates the interior from the exercise yard. A security kiosk sits behind reinforced glass. The scanner light blinks rhythmically red.

security_kiosk:
  name: "Guard Station Alpha"
  atmosphere: |
    Sterile and white. Monitors cover every wall, showing feeds from across the camp. A dead Protector drone lies sparked out on a workbench, half-disassembled.

exercise_yard:
  name: "The Cage"
  atmosphere: |
    An open-air section surrounded by thirty-foot high electrified fences. The sky above is choked with smog and Protector surveillance ships. Searchlights sweep the mud.

waste_processing:
  name: "Waste Processing"
  atmosphere: |
    The bowels of the facility. Sludge moves slowly along conveyor belts toward an incinerator. The heat is intense, and the noise is deafening.

old_sewers:
  name: "Forgotten Tunnels"

    These tunnels predate the invasion. The brickwork is crumbling, and water trickles down the walls. It's dark, damp, and smells of freedom.
