cell_block_c:
  name: "Cell Block C"
  atmosphere: |
    You stand in your cramped cell in Cell Block C. The air smells of ozone and unwashed bodies. Rows of hexagonal energy barriers normally seal each cell, humming with a headache-inducing frequency. But right now, YOUR barrier has failed - the violet shimmer that kept you caged flickers weakly, then dies completely. The power fluctuation has created your window of escape. The concrete floor is cold and stained with decades of grime.

mess_hall:
  name: "Nutrient Dispensary"

    A cavernous room lit by flickering halogen strips. Rows of metal tables are bolted to the floor. A large screen on the wall plays endless propaganda about the Protectors' mercy. The dispensing machines grind loudly.
