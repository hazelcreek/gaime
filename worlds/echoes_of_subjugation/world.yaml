premise: |
  Earth has been under the benevolent iron fist of the "Protectors" for thirty years. They claim to save humanity from itself, but their methods involve mass incarceration and neurological reprogramming. You are Prisoner 734, currently held in Detention Camp Omega-9, a facility built into the ruins of an old subway station. Rumors of a resistance cell operating near the surface have reached you. Tonight, the power grid is fluctuating. It is time to run.

starting_situation: |
  The power grid stutters and fails. For a few precious seconds, the violet energy barrier sealing your cell flickers and dies completely. The hexagonal force field that has kept you caged for months is DOWN. Old Marcus, the prisoner in the cell across from you, catches your eye through the darkness and gives you a slow, deliberate nod. This is the moment you've been waiting for. The barrier could reactivate at any second.

victory:
  location: old_sewers
  item: resistance_map
  narrative: |
    You clutch the hand-drawn map as you emerge from the forgotten tunnels into a dimly lit chamber. The graffiti on the walls reads "THEY BLEED LIKE US" - the mark of the Resistance. 
    
    A figure steps from the shadows, weapon lowered. "You made it. We've been watching Omega-9 for months, waiting for someone to break free." They extend a hand. "Welcome to Sector 4. Welcome to the fight."
    
    Behind you, the tunnels echo with distant sirens from the prison above. But ahead lies something you haven't felt in thirty years: hope.
    
    CONGRATULATIONS - You have escaped Detention Camp Omega-9!
