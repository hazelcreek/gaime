visual_setting: |
  A subterranean detention facility built into the ruins of a pre-invasion subway system, all brutalist concrete and alien technology grafted onto human infrastructure. The architectural style is oppressive institutional merged with sleek extraterrestrial design.
  The color palette is dominated by concrete gray, rust orange, sickly violet from energy barriers, and the cold blue-white of fluorescent strips. Accents include warning red, biohazard yellow, and the occasional splash of resistance graffiti.
  Materials include poured concrete stained by decades of moisture, corrugated metal panels, hexagonal force field projectors, and the gleaming chrome of Protector technology against crumbling human infrastructure.
  Lighting comes from flickering halogen strips, the ominous glow of violet energy barriers, and the cold sweep of security searchlights. Shadows are deep and perpetual.
  Environmental details include exposed pipes dripping with condensation, propaganda screens playing on endless loops, retinal scanners at every checkpoint, and surveillance drones floating through corridors. The ceiling is low, oppressive.
  Human elements survive in scratched graffiti, hidden resistance symbols, and the worn pathways of countless prisoners' feet. Everything feels monitored, controlled, and designed to break the spirit.

premise: |
  Earth has been under the benevolent iron fist of the "Protectors" for thirty years. They claim to save humanity from itself, but their methods involve mass incarceration and neurological reprogramming. You are Prisoner 734, currently held in Detention Camp Omega-9, a facility built into the ruins of an old subway station. Rumors of a resistance cell operating near the surface have reached you. Tonight, the power grid is fluctuating. It is time to run.

starting_situation: |
  The power grid stutters and fails. For a few precious seconds, the violet energy barrier sealing your cell flickers and dies completely. The hexagonal force field that has kept you caged for months is DOWN. Old Marcus, the prisoner in the cell across from you, catches your eye through the darkness and gives you a slow, deliberate nod. This is the moment you've been waiting for. The barrier could reactivate at any second.

  narrative: |
    You clutch the hand-drawn map as you emerge from the forgotten tunnels into a dimly lit chamber. The graffiti on the walls reads "THEY BLEED LIKE US" - the mark of the Resistance.

    A figure steps from the shadows, weapon lowered. "You made it. We've been watching Omega-9 for months, waiting for someone to break free." They extend a hand. "Welcome to Sector 4. Welcome to the fight."

    Behind you, the tunnels echo with distant sirens from the prison above. But ahead lies something you haven't felt in thirty years: hope.

    CONGRATULATIONS - You have escaped Detention Camp Omega-9!
