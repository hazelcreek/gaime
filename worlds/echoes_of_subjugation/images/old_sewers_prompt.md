# Image Prompt: Forgotten Tunnels

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Forgotten Tunnels
Theme: Sci-Fi Dystopia
Tone: Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Scene Description:
These tunnels predate the invasion. The brickwork is crumbling, and water trickles down the walls. It's dark, damp, and smells of freedom. This is it - the path out of Omega-9.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: stairs leading upward, or a visible upper level or balcony; an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows
Objects in the scene: Hand-drawn Map is wedged into a crack in the crumbling brick wall, folded tight and stained with damp

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
