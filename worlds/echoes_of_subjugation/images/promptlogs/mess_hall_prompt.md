# Image Prompt: Nutrient Dispensary

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Nutrient Dispensary

Scene Description:
A cavernous hall carved from an old subway platform, rows of bolted-down metal tables stretching under flickering halogen lights. To the south, the corridor leads back to Cell Block C and its flickering violet barriers.
To the east, steam billows from the Scullery doorway. To the west, heavy blast doors mark the Courtyard Access airlock. Giant propaganda screens show looping videos of alien Protector benevolence.
Industrial dispensing machines line one wall, oozing gray paste. Hollow-eyed prisoners shuffle in queues. Security cameras blink red at every angle.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Propaganda Screen: A Protector with elongated limbs speaks soothingly about obedience.
- Dispenser: It oozes a grey paste labeled 'Sustenance'.
- Visible pathway behind: The corridor back to Cell Block C and the flickering barriers, leading to Cell Block C
- Visible pathway to the right: Steam billowing from the Scullery doorway where industrial machinery hums, leading to Scullery
- Visible pathway to the left: Heavy blast doors leading to the Courtyard Access airlock, leading to Courtyard Airlock
- Unit 88, Collaborator Android, stands at the dispensing station with an unsettling smile, mechanically distributing grey paste to a queue of hollow-eyed inmates

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A subterranean detention facility built into the ruins of a pre-invasion subway system, all brutalist concrete and alien technology grafted onto human infrastructure. The architectural style is oppressive institutional merged with sleek extraterrestrial design.
The color palette is dominated by concrete gray, rust orange, sickly violet from energy barriers, and the cold blue-white of fluorescent strips. Accents include warning red, biohazard yellow, and the occasional splash of resistance graffiti.
Materials include poured concrete stained by decades of moisture, corrugated metal panels, hexagonal force field projectors, and the gleaming chrome of Protector technology against crumbling human infrastructure.
Lighting comes from flickering halogen strips, the ominous glow of violet energy barriers, and the cold sweep of security searchlights. Shadows are deep and perpetual.
Environmental details include exposed pipes dripping with condensation, propaganda screens playing on endless loops, retinal scanners at every checkpoint, and surveillance drones floating through corridors. The ceiling is low, oppressive.
Human elements survive in scratched graffiti, hidden resistance symbols, and the worn pathways of countless prisoners' feet. Everything feels monitored, controlled, and designed to break the spirit.

World Context: Sci-Fi Dystopia, Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Mood: The atmosphere is alienating, gritty, technologically oppressive, noir-influenced. neon glow cutting through darkness, holographic displays, harsh artificial light, reflections on wet surfaces. The color palette features dark base with vibrant neon accents - magenta, cyan, electric blue, toxic green against black and chrome.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic photorealism with cyberpunk aesthetic. High-quality rendering
reminiscent of V-Ray or Unreal Engine cinematics. Detailed reflections on
wet surfaces and chrome. Neon signs and holographic advertisements casting
colored light. The visual quality should evoke high-budget sci-fi films.
The visual style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from low angle emphasizing towering megastructures, or eye level for street scenes. rain, steam from grates, lens flare from neon, chromatic aberration

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cartoon or stylized
- watercolor or painterly
- vintage or retro (unless retro-futurism)
- bright daylight
- natural or organic settings
- fantasy or medieval
- clean and sterile
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- dry surfaces (everything should have wet reflections)
- cheerful or optimistic elements
