# Image Prompt: Courtyard Airlock

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Courtyard Airlock

Scene Description:
A heavy blast door separates the interior from the exercise yard. A security kiosk sits behind reinforced glass. The scanner light blinks rhythmically red.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Sci-Fi Dystopia, Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Mood: The atmosphere is alienating, gritty, technologically oppressive, noir-influenced. neon glow cutting through darkness, holographic displays, harsh artificial light, reflections on wet surfaces. The color palette features dark base with vibrant neon accents - magenta, cyan, electric blue, toxic green against black and chrome.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic photorealism with cyberpunk aesthetic. High-quality rendering
reminiscent of V-Ray or Unreal Engine cinematics. Detailed reflections on
wet surfaces and chrome. Neon signs and holographic advertisements casting
colored light. The visual quality should evoke high-budget sci-fi films.
The artistic style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from low angle emphasizing towering megastructures, or eye level for street scenes. Effects: rain, steam from grates, lens flare from neon, chromatic aberration

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cartoon or stylized
- watercolor or painterly
- vintage or retro (unless retro-futurism)
- bright daylight
- natural or organic settings
- fantasy or medieval
- clean and sterile
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- dry surfaces (everything should have wet reflections)
- cheerful or optimistic elements
