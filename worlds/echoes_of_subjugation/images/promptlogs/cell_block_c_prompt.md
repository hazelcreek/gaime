# Image Prompt: Cell Block C

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Cell Block C

Scene Description:
A narrow corridor of cramped cells carved into old subway tunnels, hexagonal energy barriers casting violet light across stained concrete walls. Your barrier is dead, its projectors sparking - the way north to the mess hall now open.
Cell after cell stretches into shadow, each containing a metal bed slab bolted to the wall, a drain in the floor, nothing else. Prisoners' faces press against the glowing barriers, watching with desperate hope.
Exposed pipes run along the ceiling dripping condensation, and decades of grime coat every surface. Fluorescent strips buzz overhead, half dead or dying.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Energy Barrier: Your cell's energy barrier has failed! The violet shimmer flickers weakly before dying completely. The way north to the mess hall is now open.
- Bed Slab: A slab of metal bolted to the wall where you've slept for months.
- Cell: Your cramped cell - four concrete walls, a metal bed slab, and normally an impassable energy barrier. Tonight, the barrier is down.
- Visible pathway ahead: The corridor leading to the Nutrient Dispensary, now unblocked by your failed barrier, leading to Nutrient Dispensary
- Nutrient Block sits half-eaten on a metal tray beside your bed slab, the grey cube barely touched
- Old Marcus, Prison Elder, lies on the bed slab in the adjacent cell, his weathered face pressed against the flickering barrier, whispering urgently

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A subterranean detention facility built into the ruins of a pre-invasion subway system, all brutalist concrete and alien technology grafted onto human infrastructure. The architectural style is oppressive institutional merged with sleek extraterrestrial design.
The color palette is dominated by concrete gray, rust orange, sickly violet from energy barriers, and the cold blue-white of fluorescent strips. Accents include warning red, biohazard yellow, and the occasional splash of resistance graffiti.
Materials include poured concrete stained by decades of moisture, corrugated metal panels, hexagonal force field projectors, and the gleaming chrome of Protector technology against crumbling human infrastructure.
Lighting comes from flickering halogen strips, the ominous glow of violet energy barriers, and the cold sweep of security searchlights. Shadows are deep and perpetual.
Environmental details include exposed pipes dripping with condensation, propaganda screens playing on endless loops, retinal scanners at every checkpoint, and surveillance drones floating through corridors. The ceiling is low, oppressive.
Human elements survive in scratched graffiti, hidden resistance symbols, and the worn pathways of countless prisoners' feet. Everything feels monitored, controlled, and designed to break the spirit.

World Context: Sci-Fi Dystopia, Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Mood: The atmosphere is alienating, gritty, technologically oppressive, noir-influenced. neon glow cutting through darkness, holographic displays, harsh artificial light, reflections on wet surfaces. The color palette features dark base with vibrant neon accents - magenta, cyan, electric blue, toxic green against black and chrome.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic photorealism with cyberpunk aesthetic. High-quality rendering
reminiscent of V-Ray or Unreal Engine cinematics. Detailed reflections on
wet surfaces and chrome. Neon signs and holographic advertisements casting
colored light. The visual quality should evoke high-budget sci-fi films.
The visual style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from low angle emphasizing towering megastructures, or eye level for street scenes. rain, steam from grates, lens flare from neon, chromatic aberration

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cartoon or stylized
- watercolor or painterly
- vintage or retro (unless retro-futurism)
- bright daylight
- natural or organic settings
- fantasy or medieval
- clean and sterile
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- dry surfaces (everything should have wet reflections)
- cheerful or optimistic elements
