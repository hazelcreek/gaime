# Image Prompt: Cell Block C

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Cell Block C

Scene Description:
You stand in your cramped cell in Cell Block C. The air smells of ozone and unwashed bodies. Rows of hexagonal energy barriers normally seal each cell, humming with a headache-inducing frequency. But right now, YOUR barrier has failed - the violet shimmer that kept you caged flickers weakly, then dies completely. The power fluctuation has created your window of escape. The concrete floor is cold and stained with decades of grime.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance
Objects in the scene: Nutrient Block sits half-eaten on a metal tray beside your bed slab, the grey cube barely touched
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Old Marcus, Prison Elder, lies on the bed slab in the adjacent cell, his weathered face pressed against the flickering barrier, whispering urgently

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Sci-Fi Dystopia, Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Mood: The atmosphere is alienating, gritty, technologically oppressive, noir-influenced. neon glow cutting through darkness, holographic displays, harsh artificial light, reflections on wet surfaces. The color palette features dark base with vibrant neon accents - magenta, cyan, electric blue, toxic green against black and chrome.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic photorealism with cyberpunk aesthetic. High-quality rendering
reminiscent of V-Ray or Unreal Engine cinematics. Detailed reflections on
wet surfaces and chrome. Neon signs and holographic advertisements casting
colored light. The visual quality should evoke high-budget sci-fi films.
The artistic style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from low angle emphasizing towering megastructures, or eye level for street scenes. Effects: rain, steam from grates, lens flare from neon, chromatic aberration

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cartoon or stylized
- watercolor or painterly
- vintage or retro (unless retro-futurism)
- bright daylight
- natural or organic settings
- fantasy or medieval
- clean and sterile
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- dry surfaces (everything should have wet reflections)
- cheerful or optimistic elements
