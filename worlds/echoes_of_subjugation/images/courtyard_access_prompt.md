# Image Prompt: Courtyard Airlock

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Courtyard Airlock
Theme: Sci-Fi Dystopia
Tone: Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Scene Description:
A heavy blast door separates the interior from the exercise yard. A security kiosk sits behind reinforced glass. The scanner light blinks rhythmically red.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
