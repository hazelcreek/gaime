# Image Prompt: Maintenance Shed

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Maintenance Shed
Theme: Sci-Fi Dystopia
Tone: Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Scene Description:
A cramped structure filled with old tools and cleaning supplies. A hidden hatch is barely visible under a pile of oily rags.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; stairs descending, a trapdoor, or a passage leading below
Objects in the scene: UV Flashlight has rolled beneath a dusty workbench, its military-grade casing barely visible in the gloom

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
