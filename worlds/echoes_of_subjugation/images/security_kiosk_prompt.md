# Image Prompt: Guard Station Alpha

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Guard Station Alpha
Theme: Sci-Fi Dystopia
Tone: Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Scene Description:
Sterile and white. Monitors cover every wall, showing feeds from across the camp. A dead Protector drone lies sparked out on a workbench, half-disassembled.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows
Objects in the scene: Blue Security Card lies carelessly on the main console desk, left behind by whoever last manned this station
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Rin, Hacker, crouches beneath the monitor bank, fingers flying over exposed circuitry, glancing nervously at the door every few seconds

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
