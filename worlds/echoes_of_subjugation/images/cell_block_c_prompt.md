# Image Prompt: Cell Block C

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Cell Block C
Theme: Sci-Fi Dystopia
Tone: Oppressive, Desperate, Synthetic

Scene Description:
You stand in your cramped cell in Cell Block C. The air smells of ozone and unwashed bodies. Rows of hexagonal energy barriers normally seal each cell, humming with a headache-inducing frequency. But right now, YOUR barrier has failed - the violet shimmer that kept you caged flickers weakly, then dies completely. The power fluctuation has created your window of escape. The concrete floor is cold and stained with decades of grime.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance
Objects in the scene: Nutrient Block sits half-eaten on a metal tray beside your bed slab, the grey cube barely touched
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Old Marcus, Prison Elder, lies on the bed slab in the adjacent cell, his weathered face pressed against the flickering barrier, whispering urgently

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
