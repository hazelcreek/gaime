  examine_description: |
    A yellowed letter, hastily crumpled and then smoothed out again.
    The elegant handwriting is slightly smudged, as if by tears:

    "My dearest Margaret,

    The ritual must never be completed. I have hidden the final
    component where the children played their secret games. Edmund
    believes immortality is worth any price, but I have seen what
    waits on the other side. It hungers.

    If you find this, know that I tried to stop it. Find the artifacts.
    Destroy them if you can, or at least keep them separated.

    Forgive me for not being stronger.

    - Your loving sister, Catherine"
