entrance_hall:
  name: "Entrance Hall"
  atmosphere: |
    A grand but decayed entrance hall greets you. A crystal chandelier
    hangs dark and dusty overhead, its candles long since melted away.
    Faded portraits line the wood-paneled walls, their subjects watching
    with painted eyes that seem to follow your movement. The air smells
    of old wood, dust, and something faintly metallic. Rain hammers
    against the windows, and occasional lightning illuminates the decay.
  visual_description: |
    A cavernous entrance hall with vaulted ceilings lost in shadow, dominated by a grand staircase that sweeps upward into darkness toward the upper landing. The walls are paneled in dark mahogany, carved with elaborate Victorian motifs now fuzzy with dust.
    To the north, an ornate archway leads into a book-lined library. To the east, a heavy oak door with tarnished brass handles stands closed. To the west, a set of double doors stands slightly ajar, revealing a darkened parlor beyond.
    A massive crystal chandelier hangs askew, its crystals clouded gray. Black and white marble tiles checker the floor, cracked and gapping. Cobwebs connect every surface like gray lace, and lightning flashes through rain-lashed windows.

  atmosphere: |
    Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves stuffed with ancient tomes line every wall.
    The smell of aged paper and leather fills the air. A cold draft whispers
    through the room, making the pages of an open book flutter. Moonlight
    filters through a grimy window, illuminating dust motes that drift like
    snow. A massive oak desk dominates the center, covered in papers.
  visual_description: |
    A two-story library with towering bookshelves of dark wood reaching toward a shadowed ceiling, connected by a narrow wrought-iron gallery. To the south, an ornate archway leads back to the entrance hall beyond.
    Thousands of leather-bound books in deep reds, greens, and browns crowd every shelf. A massive oak desk sits in the center, buried under scattered papers and quills. Moonlight filters through a tall grimy window.
    A library ladder on brass rails leans against one bookcase. One red book on the middle shelf protrudes slightly, as if waiting to be pulled. The carpets are threadbare Persian, their patterns faded to ghosts.

  visual_description: |
    A narrow stone corridor of ancient construction, far older than the Victorian manor above. Behind you, the hidden bookshelf door stands open, revealing the warm glow of the library beyond.
    The rough-hewn walls are damp with moisture, covered in lichen and strange carved symbols. Cobwebs hang in thick curtains, parting like gray veils. The floor is uneven flagstone, worn smooth by generations of secret footsteps.
