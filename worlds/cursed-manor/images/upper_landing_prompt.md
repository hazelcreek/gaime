# Image Prompt: Upper Landing

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Upper Landing

Scene Description:
A long hallway on the upper floor, lit by flickering wall sconces that shouldn't still be burning. Doors line both sides, most closed. A window at the end shows the storm still raging. The floorboards creak with every step, and sometimes you hear creaking when you stand still...

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: stairs descending, a trapdoor, or a passage leading below; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Artistic style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The artistic style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. Effects: volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- bright and cheerful
- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
- anime or manga

- clean and polished
