# Image Prompt: Upper Landing

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Upper Landing
Theme: Victorian gothic horror
Tone: atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Scene Description:
A long hallway on the upper floor, lit by flickering wall sconces that shouldn't still be burning. Doors line both sides, most closed. A window at the end shows the storm still raging. The floorboards creak with every step, and sometimes you hear creaking when you stand still...

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: stairs descending, a trapdoor, or a passage leading below; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
