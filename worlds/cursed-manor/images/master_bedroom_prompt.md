# Image Prompt: Master Bedroom

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Master Bedroom
Theme: Victorian gothic horror
Tone: atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Scene Description:
The master bedroom is large and cold. A four-poster bed dominates the room, its curtains torn and moth-eaten. A vanity mirror reflects the room, but something about the reflection seems... wrong. A wardrobe stands against one wall, its doors slightly ajar.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows
Objects in the scene: Heavy Iron Key hangs from a hook inside the wardrobe, cold and heavy, as if deliberately hidden away

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
