# Image Prompt: Nursery

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Nursery

Scene Description:
A children's nursery frozen in interrupted play, toys scattered across the faded carpet - wooden soldiers fallen in mid-battle, a ball abandoned, a doll with missing eyes staring blankly. To the north, the faded blue door leads back to the upper landing.
Three small iron-frame beds line one wall, their covers thrown back as if the occupants just rose. A rocking horse in the corner sways gently on its own, its paint chipped to reveal darker layers beneath.
Childish drawings paper every wall - some showing happy family scenes, others depicting disturbing imagery: dark figures, fire, crying faces. A toy chest stands open, its contents spilled. Moonlight casts long shadows.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Toys: Toys scattered mid-play - a ball, wooden soldiers, a doll with no eyes
- Children's Beds: Three beds for three children, none of whom sleep here anymore
- Drawings: Children's drawings, some happy, some nightmarish
- Rocking Horse: The rocking horse moves on its own, back and forth, back and forth
- Visible pathway ahead: The faded blue door leading back to the upper landing, leading to Upper Landing

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
