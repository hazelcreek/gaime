# Image Prompt: Guest Room

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Guest Room

Scene Description:
A modest guest bedroom with simpler furnishings than the rest of the manor, but still elegant in decay. To the west, the plain door leads back to the upper landing with its uncanny blue-flamed sconces.
A single brass bed with an inexplicably fresh-made quilt occupies the center, as if expecting a visitor. A writing desk of dark wood sits by the rain-lashed window, equipped with paper and dried inkwell.
Floral wallpaper peels at the seams, and a water stain spreads across the ceiling from some long-ago leak. A plain wardrobe stands in the corner, its door closed tight. The floorboards creak with every movement.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Guest Bed: The bed is freshly made, as if expecting a guest
- Writing Desk: A writing desk with paper and dried-up ink
- Window: The window rattles in the storm
- Visible pathway to the left: The plain door leading back to the upper landing, leading to Upper Landing
- Box of Matches rest on the writing desk beside a dried-out inkwell, as if left for a late-night letter

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
