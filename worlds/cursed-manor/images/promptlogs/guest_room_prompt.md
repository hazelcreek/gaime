# Image Prompt: Guest Room

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Guest Room

Scene Description:
A modest guest room, less ornate than the master bedroom but comfortable enough. The bed appears recently made - odd, in a house this abandoned. A writing desk sits by the window, and a wardrobe stands in the corner.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene
Objects in the scene: Box of Matches rest on the writing desk beside a dried-out inkwell, as if left for a late-night letter

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Artistic style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The artistic style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. Effects: volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- bright and cheerful
- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
- anime or manga
- photorealistic
- clean and polished
- watermarks or signatures
- text overlays
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
