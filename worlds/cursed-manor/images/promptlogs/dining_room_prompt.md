This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Dining Room

Scene Description:
A formal dining room dominated by a long mahogany table set for six, the place settings frozen in time - bone china bearing the family crest, tarnished silver flatware, crystal glasses clouded with dust.
To the west, the heavy oak door with tarnished brass handles leads back to the entrance hall. To the north, a service door provides access to the kitchen beyond.
A massive fireplace of carved marble dominates one wall, cold and dark. A grandfather clock stands in the corner, its pendulum swinging impossibly. Heavy burgundy drapes frame windows rattling with the storm.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Dining Table: The table is set for six, but the food has long since rotted away
- Grandfather Clock: The grandfather clock keeps perfect time - 11:47 PM. How is it still running?
- Fireplace: The fireplace is cold, but there's a strange draft coming from it
- Fine China: Fine bone china with the family crest - a thorned tree
- Visible pathway to the left: The heavy oak door leading back to the entrance hall, leading to Entrance Hall
- Visible pathway ahead: A service door leading to the kitchen, leading to Kitchen
- Small Silver Key glints beneath the dining table, half-hidden among the dusty chair legs
- Jenkins (The elderly butler, last remaining servant of the manor), stands rigidly beside the grandfather clock, his pale hands clasped before him, watching you with hollow eyes: An elderly man, perhaps seventy, impeccably dressed in formal butler's attire that has seen better days. His face is gaunt and pale, with dark circles under watchful, haunted eyes. His hands tremble slightly when he thinks no one is looking. Despite his age, he moves with practiced grace born of decades of service.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow
