# Image Prompt: Kitchen

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Kitchen

Scene Description:
A large servants' kitchen with a massive stone hearth cold and dark, its iron crane and hooks still in place. To the south, the service door leads back to the dining room. A heavy door with an iron lock leads down to the basement.
Copper pots hang from ceiling racks, their surfaces green with verdigris. Stone preparation tables line the walls, covered in dust and the residue of long-ago meals. Cast iron stoves sit dormant.
Pantry shelves visible through an open door are bare. A dumbwaiter shaft stands open and dark. A single window high on the wall shows only storm-darkness.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Hearth: The hearth is large enough to roast a whole pig
- Pantry: The pantry door hangs open, revealing bare shelves
- Copper Pots: Beautiful copper pots, now green with verdigris
- Basement Door: A heavy door with an iron lock leading to the basement stairs
- Visible pathway behind: The service door leading back to the dining room, leading to Dining Room
- Visible pathway below: A heavy door with an iron lock leading to the basement stairs, leading to Basement
- Kitchen Knife lies on the stone preparation counter near the hearth, its blade stained dark

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
