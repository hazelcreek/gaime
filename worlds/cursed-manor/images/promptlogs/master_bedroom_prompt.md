This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Master Bedroom

Scene Description:
A grand but cold bedroom dominated by an enormous four-poster bed of dark carved wood, its velvet curtains torn and moth-eaten. To the south, the imposing door leads back to the upper landing's blue-flamed sconces.
A vanity mirror in an ornate gilt frame reflects the room, the glass clouded with age, distorting the reflection subtly. A massive wardrobe of dark wood stands against one wall, its doors slightly ajar.
A portrait of a beautiful woman in Victorian dress hangs above the bed, her painted eyes sad. Heavy drapes block the windows, and dust covers every surface like gray snow. A music box sits on the dresser, silent.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Four-Poster Bed: The bed is made, as if waiting for occupants who will never return
- Vanity Mirror: The mirror shows the room, but the shadows seem to move independently
- Wardrobe: The wardrobe door creaks when touched
- Portrait: A portrait of the lady of the house hangs above the bed
- Visible pathway behind: The door leading back to the upper landing, leading to Upper Landing
- Heavy Iron Key hangs from a hook inside the wardrobe, cold and heavy, as if deliberately hidden away

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
