# Image Prompt: The Library

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Library

Scene Description:
A two-story library with towering bookshelves of dark wood reaching toward a shadowed ceiling, connected by a narrow wrought-iron gallery. To the south, an ornate archway leads back to the entrance hall beyond.
Thousands of leather-bound books in deep reds, greens, and browns crowd every shelf. A massive oak desk sits in the center, buried under scattered papers and quills. Moonlight filters through a tall grimy window.
A library ladder on brass rails leans against one bookcase. One red book on the middle shelf protrudes slightly, as if waiting to be pulled. The carpets are threadbare Persian, their patterns faded to ghosts.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Bookshelves: Thousands of books on every subject - history, science, and disturbingly many on the occult
- Oak Desk: The desk is covered in handwritten notes, many featuring strange symbols
- Window: The window looks out onto an overgrown garden, barely visible through rain and grime
- Red Book: One book on the middle shelf stands out - bound in red leather, it protrudes slightly
- Visible pathway behind: The archway leading back to the entrance hall, leading to Entrance Hall
- Occult Tome lies open on the massive oak desk, its yellowed pages stirring in the draft
- Silver Reading Glasses rest beside the open book on the desk, as if their owner just stepped away

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- bright and cheerful
- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
- anime or manga
- photorealistic
- clean and polished
- watermarks or signatures
