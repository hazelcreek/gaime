Location: Ritual Chamber

Scene Description:
A perfectly circular chamber carved from living rock, its domed ceiling lost in shadow above. The narrow stone stairs ascend back toward the secret passage and the manor above.
The floor is smooth black stone, painted with an elaborate ritual circle of concentric rings and arcane symbols in dark rusty red. Three stone pedestals stand at equidistant points around the circle, their surfaces carved with warning glyphs.
Hundreds of candles line ledges around the walls, their wax frozen in long drips. The air shimmers faintly, charged with unnatural energy. Ancient iron chains hang from the ceiling above the circle's center.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Blood Symbols: The painted symbols match those from the notes - this is where the ritual was performed
- Stone Pedestals: Three stone pedestals, clearly meant to hold something important. They seem to be waiting for the artifacts.
- Ritual Circle: The ritual circle is incomplete - something interrupted the ceremony
- Visible pathway above: The narrow stone stairs leading back up to the secret passage, leading to Secret Passage
- Notable object: Thornwood Grimoire rests upon the central pedestal, its pale leather binding seeming to glow faintly in the darkness

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
