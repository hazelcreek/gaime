Location: Sitting Room

Scene Description:
An intimate parlor with velvet furniture arranged around a marble fireplace, the upholstery faded from crimson to dusty rose, moth-eaten but still arranged as if expecting guests. To the east, the double doors stand slightly ajar, leading back to the entrance hall.
A grand piano occupies one corner. Family photographs in tarnished silver frames crowd the mantelpiece, showing smiling faces frozen in happier times. Lace doilies cover every surface, yellowed with age.
Heavy brocade curtains block the windows, muffling the storm outside. An ornate music box sits on a side table, and fresh logs are inexplicably laid in the cold fireplace. The wallpaper peels in long curling strips.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Grand Piano: A beautiful grand piano, covered in dust but potentially still playable
- Photographs: Photos of the family - the children smiling, the parents proud
- Fireplace: The fireplace is cold, but laid with fresh logs... strange
- Curtains: Heavy velvet curtains, faded from deep red to dusty pink
- Visible pathway to the right: The double doors leading back to the entrance hall, leading to Entrance Hall
- Family Photograph sits in a tarnished silver frame on the mantelpiece, the family frozen in a moment of happiness

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow
