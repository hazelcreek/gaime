This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Entrance Hall

Scene Description:
A cavernous entrance hall with vaulted ceilings lost in shadow, dominated by a grand staircase that sweeps upward into darkness toward the upper landing. The walls are paneled in dark mahogany, carved with elaborate Victorian motifs now fuzzy with dust.
To the north, an ornate archway leads into a book-lined library. To the east, a heavy oak door with tarnished brass handles stands closed. To the west, a set of double doors stands slightly ajar, revealing a darkened parlor beyond.
A massive crystal chandelier hangs askew, its crystals clouded gray. Black and white marble tiles checker the floor, cracked and gapping. Cobwebs connect every surface like gray lace, and lightning flashes through rain-lashed windows.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Family Portraits: Five family portraits hang on the walls - a stern father, a beautiful mother, and three children of varying ages
- Crystal Chandelier: The chandelier must have been magnificent once. Now it hangs crooked, crystals clouded with decades of dust
- Marble Floor: Black and white marble tiles, cracked and worn by countless footsteps
- Front Door: The front door is heavy oak, reinforced with iron. The storm rages outside
- Visible pathway ahead: An ornate archway leading into a book-lined room, leading to The Library
- Visible pathway to the right: A heavy oak door with tarnished brass handles
- Visible pathway to the left: A set of double doors, slightly ajar, leading to a darkened parlor
- Visible pathway above: A grand staircase sweeping upward into shadow
- Crumpled Letter lies crumpled on the dusty side table beside the front door, as if dropped in haste
- Silver Candlestick sits on the narrow console table beneath the portraits, its candle melted to a stub

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A decaying Victorian mansion consumed by supernatural decay and neglect. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic with pointed arches, ornate carved woodwork, and elaborate moldings, all now crumbling and covered in decades of dust and cobwebs.
The color palette is dominated by deep purples, blacks, and grays, with accents of tarnished gold, faded crimson velvet, and the sickly green of verdigris on brass fixtures. Everything has a layer of dust and shadow.
Materials include dark mahogany paneling, cracked marble floors, moth-eaten velvet upholstery, and age-clouded crystal chandeliers. Wallpaper peels in long strips, revealing older, darker patterns beneath.
Lighting comes from guttering candles, blue-tinged gaslight sconces that shouldn't still be burning, and occasional lightning flashes through grimy windows. Shadows are deep and seem to move independently.
Environmental details include cobwebs in every corner, dust motes floating in light beams, faded family portraits with eyes that follow, and clocks that still tick impossibly. Decay is beautiful here - rot has an elegance.
The aesthetic is romantic horror - beautiful in its desolation, with the grandeur of what was contrasting with the horror of what remains. Everything suggests interrupted life, frozen in a moment of tragedy.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Visual style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The visual style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow
