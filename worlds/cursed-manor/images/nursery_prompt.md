# Image Prompt: Nursery

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: Nursery
Theme: Victorian gothic horror
Tone: atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Scene Description:
A children's nursery, toys scattered across the floor as if play was interrupted suddenly. A rocking horse sways gently, though there's no breeze. Three small beds line one wall, their covers thrown back. Childish drawings paper the walls, but some show disturbing imagery - dark figures, flames, crying faces.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance
Barely perceptible elements: something barely visible that could be thornwood amulet, perhaps catching a sliver of light or partially obscured

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
