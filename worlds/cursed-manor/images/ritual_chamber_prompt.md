# Image Prompt: Ritual Chamber

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Ritual Chamber

Scene Description:
A circular chamber carved from the living rock. Strange symbols are painted on the floor in what looks disturbingly like dried blood. Three pedestals stand at points around the circle, two of them empty. Candles line the walls, unlit but leaving trails of ancient wax. The air feels heavy, charged with something unnatural.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Subtle environmental details: shadows on the ceiling that hint at an unseen passage
Significant objects: a notable object (Thornwood Grimoire) rests upon the central pedestal, its pale leather binding seeming to glow faintly in the darkness, drawing the eye with subtle presence

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Artistic style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The artistic style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. Effects: volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow

- bright and cheerful
- colorful and vibrant
- cartoon or whimsical
- anime or manga
- photorealistic
- clean and polished
- watermarks or signatures

- blurry or low-quality artifacts
