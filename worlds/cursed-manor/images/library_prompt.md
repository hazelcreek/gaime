# Image Prompt: The Library

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: The Library
Theme: Victorian gothic horror
Tone: atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Scene Description:
Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves stuffed with ancient tomes line every wall. The smell of aged paper and leather fills the air. A cold draft whispers through the room, making the pages of an open book flutter. Moonlight filters through a grimy window, illuminating dust motes that drift like snow. A massive oak desk dominates the center, covered in papers.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows
Objects in the scene: Occult Tome lies open on the massive oak desk, its yellowed pages stirring in the draft; Silver Reading Glasses rest beside the open book on the desk, as if their owner just stepped away

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
