# Image Prompt: Nursery

Edit this image to add the following character(s) while preserving the scene exactly:

Location: Nursery
Theme: Victorian gothic horror
Tone: atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Characters to add:
- The Whisper (Spirit of the youngest child, Emily) positioned naturally in the scene: A translucent figure of a young girl, perhaps eight years old, dressed in a white nightgown. Her form flickers like candlelight, fading in and out of visibility. Her face is sad but not frightening. She points and gestures but cannot speak - her voice was taken by the ritual.

Critical Requirements:
- PRESERVE the original scene's composition, lighting, colors, and atmosphere completely
- PRESERVE all existing elements: architecture, furniture, objects, exits, and environmental details
- ADD the character(s) naturally integrated into the existing scene
- MATCH the artistic style, perspective, and rendering of the original image
- Position the character(s) where they would naturally appear in this space
- The character(s) should look like they belong in this scene, with appropriate lighting and shadows
- Do NOT change any part of the background or environment
- Do NOT add any new objects or elements besides the specified character(s)
- Maintain the 16:9 widescreen composition
