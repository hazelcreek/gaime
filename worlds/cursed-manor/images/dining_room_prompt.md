Location: Dining Room

Scene Description:
A long mahogany table dominates this room, set for a dinner that was never eaten. Dust covers everything - the fine china, the silver candlesticks, the crystal glasses. A grandfather clock ticks steadily in the corner, impossibly still working. The east wall features a large fireplace, cold and dark.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance
Objects in the scene: Small Silver Key glints beneath the dining table, half-hidden among the dusty chair legs
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Jenkins (The elderly butler, last remaining servant of the manor), stands rigidly beside the grandfather clock, his pale hands clasped before him, watching you with hollow eyes: An elderly man, perhaps seventy, impeccably dressed in formal butler's attire that has seen better days. His face is gaunt and pale, with dark circles under watchful, haunted eyes. His hands tremble s

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Victorian gothic horror, atmospheric, mysterious, unsettling yet compelling

Mood: The atmosphere is ominous, mysterious, foreboding, melancholic. dramatic chiaroscuro, pools of dim light in oppressive darkness, flickering flames. The color palette features muted and desaturated with deep shadows, occasional accent colors (blood red, sickly green, pale blue).

Artistic style (most important): Dark fantasy digital painting with heavy atmosphere. Painterly execution with
visible brushstrokes, emphasizing shadow and mystery. Gothic architectural
influences, decayed grandeur. The mood should feel oppressive yet beautiful.
The artistic style is paramount and must be maintained consistently.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or slightly low angle for imposing scenes. Effects: volumetric fog, dust motes in light beams, subtle ethereal glow
