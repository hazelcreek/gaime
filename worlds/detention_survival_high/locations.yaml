  name: "The Main Hallway"
  atmosphere: |
    The linoleum floor stretches out endlessly, reflecting the orange glow of the late afternoon sun streaming through the trophy case glass. It's unnervingly quiet, save for the hum of the vending machine. The lockers line the walls like silent metal soldiers.

principal_office:
  name: "Principal Skinner's Office"
  atmosphere: |
    The air here smells of stale coffee and bureaucratic dread. A massive mahogany desk dominates the room. Behind it, a portrait of the school mascot (a confused badger) stares judgingly at you.

science_lab:
  name: "The Science Lab"

    Bunsen burners sit cold on black countertops. A skeleton model in the corner is wearing a tie-dye t-shirt. The periodic table on the wall has several elements spelled wrong.

gymnasium:
  name: "The Gymnasium"

    The squeak of sneakers is ghosted into the hardwood floor. It smells of sweat and rubber. The bleachers are retracted, creating a cavernous echo whenever you move.

locker_room:

    Damp, dark, and smelling of Axe body spray. A single shower head drips rhythmically: drip... drip... drip. It's the scariest place in the school.

    Behind the serving line. Industrial sized mixers and ovens loom like metal giants. It's surprisingly clean, except for a pile of unfinished tater tots.
