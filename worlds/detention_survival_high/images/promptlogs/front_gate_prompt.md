Location: The Front Gate

Scene Description:
A tall chain-link fence topped with decorative but rusty barbed wire, the main gate secured with a heavy-duty padlock and chain. Behind you, the school's main entrance doors lead back into the brick prison.
The school name is spelled out in plastic letters on a brick sign, some letters faded or missing. Beyond the fence, freedom stretches out - an empty parking lot with faded lines, a single beige sedan, and a stray shopping cart.
The late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the concrete. The distant sounds of traffic and normal life drift tantalizingly close. A "GO BADGERS!" banner flutters half-heartedly from a flagpole.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Front Gate: A heavy padlock secures the gate. It looks like it needs a specific key from the janitor's keyring.
- Chain-Link Fence: Too high to climb, especially with that barbed wire. You'd need to be Spider-Man.
- Parking Lot: Empty except for Principal Skinner's beige sedan and a lone shopping cart.
- Visible pathway: The main entrance doors leading back into the school, leading to The Main Hallway

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A quintessential American public high school frozen in the late 1990s/early 2000s, all institutional architecture and accidental nostalgia. The building is red brick exterior with aluminum-frame windows, fluorescent-lit hallways, and that specific shade of institutional beige on every wall.
The color palette features locker-gray, linoleum-tan, trophy-case gold, and the orange-tinted afternoon sunlight that streams through every window at 4 PM. Accents include hand-painted spirit banners, faded motivational posters, and outdated safety notices.
Materials include cold metal lockers, sticky cafeteria tables, scuffed gymnasium floors of honey-colored hardwood, and the eternal linoleum that remembers every sneaker that ever squeaked across it.
Environmental details include trophy cases full of participation awards, bulletin boards with outdated announcements, water fountains that never have enough pressure, and vending machines glowing in alcoves. The ceiling tiles are that perforated acoustic type, some stained by ancient leaks.
The lighting is harsh fluorescent with that characteristic buzz, except where late afternoon sun creates golden shafts through dusty windows. The aesthetic is John Hughes meets detention - simultaneously nostalgic and oppressive.
Background extras would include abandoned backpacks, forgotten hall passes, and the evidence of student life just departed - erasers on desks, gum under tables, and doodles on every available surface.

World Context: High School Comedy, Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Mood: The atmosphere is lighthearted, nostalgic, warm, comedic, slightly irreverent. bright natural daylight, warm golden hour glow, soft shadows, slightly overexposed highlights, sunlight streaming through windows. The color palette features warm and saturated, golden yellows, soft oranges, blue skies, green grass, the warm tones of late 90s film stock.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
Shot on 35mm film with natural bokeh and gentle lens flares from sunlight.
The photographic quality is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level, 35mm lens. subtle film grain, warm color grading, natural lens flare, soft focus backgrounds
