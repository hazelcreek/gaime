This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Main Hallway

Scene Description:
An endless corridor of beige linoleum stretching into the distance, the floor reflecting the orange glow of late afternoon sun streaming through tall windows. Metal lockers in institutional gray line both walls like silent soldiers.
To the north, the frosted glass of the Principal's Office looms ominously. To the east, double doors with porthole windows lead to the cafeteria. To the west, a door marked "SCIENCE LAB" waits. To the south, large gymnasium doors with push-bars beckon.
A glass trophy case displays rows of tarnished awards. Motivational posters curl at their corners, faded by fluorescent exposure. A lone vending machine hums in an alcove, casting blue light.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Trophy Case: Full of participation trophies from 1998.
- Lockers: Most are locked, but one (number 404) is slightly ajar.
- Visible pathway ahead: The ominous door to the Principal's Office, its frosted glass window reading 'PRINCIPAL SKINNER', leading to Principal Skinner's Office
- Visible pathway to the right: Double doors with porthole windows leading to the cafeteria, leading to The Cafeteria
- Visible pathway to the left: A door marked with a faded 'SCIENCE LAB' sign and a biohazard sticker, leading to The Science Lab
- Visible pathway behind: The large gymnasium doors with their institutional push-bars, leading to The Gymnasium
- Visible pathway: The main entrance doors leading to the locked front gate, leading to The Front Gate
- Laminated Hall Pass sits forgotten on a wooden bench beneath the trophy case, its laminated surface catching the afternoon light

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A quintessential American public high school frozen in the late 1990s/early 2000s, all institutional architecture and accidental nostalgia. The building is red brick exterior with aluminum-frame windows, fluorescent-lit hallways, and that specific shade of institutional beige on every wall.
The color palette features locker-gray, linoleum-tan, trophy-case gold, and the orange-tinted afternoon sunlight that streams through every window at 4 PM. Accents include hand-painted spirit banners, faded motivational posters, and outdated safety notices.
Materials include cold metal lockers, sticky cafeteria tables, scuffed gymnasium floors of honey-colored hardwood, and the eternal linoleum that remembers every sneaker that ever squeaked across it.
Environmental details include trophy cases full of participation awards, bulletin boards with outdated announcements, water fountains that never have enough pressure, and vending machines glowing in alcoves. The ceiling tiles are that perforated acoustic type, some stained by ancient leaks.
The lighting is harsh fluorescent with that characteristic buzz, except where late afternoon sun creates golden shafts through dusty windows. The aesthetic is John Hughes meets detention - simultaneously nostalgic and oppressive.
Background extras would include abandoned backpacks, forgotten hall passes, and the evidence of student life just departed - erasers on desks, gum under tables, and doodles on every available surface.

World Context: High School Comedy, Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Mood: The atmosphere is lighthearted, nostalgic, warm, comedic, slightly irreverent. bright natural daylight, warm golden hour glow, soft shadows, slightly overexposed highlights, sunlight streaming through windows. The color palette features warm and saturated, golden yellows, soft oranges, blue skies, green grass, the warm tones of late 90s film stock.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
Shot on 35mm film with natural bokeh and gentle lens flares from sunlight.
The photographic quality is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level, 35mm lens. subtle film grain, warm color grading, natural lens flare, soft focus backgrounds
