# Image Prompt: The Cafeteria

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Cafeteria

Scene Description:
Tables are folded up against the wall. The lingering scent of mystery meat and bleach hangs heavy. Dust motes dance in the light beams hitting the serving station.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance
Objects in the scene: The Spatula of Destiny leans against the stainless steel serving counter, its industrial size suggesting it has flipped a thousand mystery meat patties
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Lunch Lady Doris, The Gatekeeper, stands behind the serving counter with arms crossed, hairnet askew, guarding the kitchen entrance like a gruff sentinel

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
