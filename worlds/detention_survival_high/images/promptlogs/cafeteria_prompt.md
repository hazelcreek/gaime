# Image Prompt: The Cafeteria

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Cafeteria

Scene Description:
A cavernous cafeteria with round tables folded and stacked against the walls, revealing a permanently sticky floor. To the west, double doors with porthole windows lead back to the main hallway. To the north, a swinging door marked "STAFF ONLY" guards the kitchen.
A stainless steel serving line stretches along one wall, its sneeze guards gleaming, the food wells empty and dark. "MENU" boards display faded descriptions of meals that sound like cruel jokes.
Afternoon sunlight streams through high windows, illuminating drifting dust motes. Motivational banners reading "HEALTHY CHOICES!" hang from the ceiling. The walls are painted cinder block, and somewhere, a refrigerator hums.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Serving Station: Currently serving nothing but disappointment.
- Cafeteria Floor: Sticky. It's always sticky.
- Visible pathway to the left: The double doors leading back to the main hallway, leading to The Main Hallway
- Visible pathway ahead: A swinging door marked 'STAFF ONLY' leading to the kitchen, leading to The Kitchen
- The Spatula of Destiny leans against the stainless steel serving counter, its industrial size suggesting it has flipped a thousand mystery meat patties
- Lunch Lady Doris, The Gatekeeper, stands behind the serving counter with arms crossed, hairnet askew, guarding the kitchen entrance like a gruff sentinel

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A quintessential American public high school frozen in the late 1990s/early 2000s, all institutional architecture and accidental nostalgia. The building is red brick exterior with aluminum-frame windows, fluorescent-lit hallways, and that specific shade of institutional beige on every wall.
The color palette features locker-gray, linoleum-tan, trophy-case gold, and the orange-tinted afternoon sunlight that streams through every window at 4 PM. Accents include hand-painted spirit banners, faded motivational posters, and outdated safety notices.
Materials include cold metal lockers, sticky cafeteria tables, scuffed gymnasium floors of honey-colored hardwood, and the eternal linoleum that remembers every sneaker that ever squeaked across it.
Environmental details include trophy cases full of participation awards, bulletin boards with outdated announcements, water fountains that never have enough pressure, and vending machines glowing in alcoves. The ceiling tiles are that perforated acoustic type, some stained by ancient leaks.
The lighting is harsh fluorescent with that characteristic buzz, except where late afternoon sun creates golden shafts through dusty windows. The aesthetic is John Hughes meets detention - simultaneously nostalgic and oppressive.
Background extras would include abandoned backpacks, forgotten hall passes, and the evidence of student life just departed - erasers on desks, gum under tables, and doodles on every available surface.

World Context: High School Comedy, Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Mood: The atmosphere is lighthearted, nostalgic, warm, comedic, slightly irreverent. bright natural daylight, warm golden hour glow, soft shadows, slightly overexposed highlights, sunlight streaming through windows. The color palette features warm and saturated, golden yellows, soft oranges, blue skies, green grass, the warm tones of late 90s film stock.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
Shot on 35mm film with natural bokeh and gentle lens flares from sunlight.
The photographic quality is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level, 35mm lens. subtle film grain, warm color grading, natural lens flare, soft focus backgrounds
