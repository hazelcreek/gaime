# Image Prompt: The Kitchen

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Kitchen

Scene Description:
Behind the serving line. Industrial sized mixers and ovens loom like metal giants. It's surprisingly clean, except for a pile of unfinished tater tots.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows
Objects in the scene: Jug of Vinegar sits on the counter by the industrial sink, its plastic jug half-empty and smelling sharply acidic

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: High School Comedy, Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Mood: The atmosphere is lighthearted, nostalgic, warm, comedic, slightly irreverent. bright natural daylight, warm golden hour glow, soft shadows, slightly overexposed highlights, sunlight streaming through windows. The color palette features warm and saturated, golden yellows, soft oranges, blue skies, green grass, the warm tones of late 90s film stock.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
Shot on 35mm film with natural bokeh and gentle lens flares from sunlight.
The photographic quality is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level, 35mm lens. Effects: subtle film grain, warm color grading, natural lens flare, soft focus backgrounds

- dark or gritty

- cold blue tones
