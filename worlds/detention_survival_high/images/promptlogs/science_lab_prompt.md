# Image Prompt: The Science Lab

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Science Lab

Scene Description:
A chemistry lab with rows of black granite-topped lab stations, each equipped with gas nozzles, sinks, and Bunsen burners sitting cold. To the east, the door marked "SCIENCE LAB" leads back to the main hallway.
A skeleton model in the corner has been dressed in a tie-dye t-shirt and sunglasses by generations of students. The periodic table on the wall is enormous, and someone has drawn mustaches on several element portraits.
Glass-fronted cabinets display jars of mysterious preserved specimens. Safety goggles hang on hooks, and a faded "SAFETY FIRST" poster shows dated hairstyles. Stools are pushed in at odd angles.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Skeleton Model: His name tag says 'Mr. Bones'.
- Blackboard: Someone has drawn a complex diagram of a spitball trajectory.
- Visible pathway to the right: The door back to the main hallway, leading to The Main Hallway
- Box of Baking Soda sits on the black countertop next to a collection of beakers, its orange box faded from years of science fair volcanoes
- Neil the Science Club President, The Hint Giver, crouches behind the teacher's desk, peeking out nervously, his thick glasses catching the fluorescent light

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A quintessential American public high school frozen in the late 1990s/early 2000s, all institutional architecture and accidental nostalgia. The building is red brick exterior with aluminum-frame windows, fluorescent-lit hallways, and that specific shade of institutional beige on every wall.
The color palette features locker-gray, linoleum-tan, trophy-case gold, and the orange-tinted afternoon sunlight that streams through every window at 4 PM. Accents include hand-painted spirit banners, faded motivational posters, and outdated safety notices.
Materials include cold metal lockers, sticky cafeteria tables, scuffed gymnasium floors of honey-colored hardwood, and the eternal linoleum that remembers every sneaker that ever squeaked across it.
Environmental details include trophy cases full of participation awards, bulletin boards with outdated announcements, water fountains that never have enough pressure, and vending machines glowing in alcoves. The ceiling tiles are that perforated acoustic type, some stained by ancient leaks.
The lighting is harsh fluorescent with that characteristic buzz, except where late afternoon sun creates golden shafts through dusty windows. The aesthetic is John Hughes meets detention - simultaneously nostalgic and oppressive.
Background extras would include abandoned backpacks, forgotten hall passes, and the evidence of student life just departed - erasers on desks, gum under tables, and doodles on every available surface.

World Context: High School Comedy, Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Mood: The atmosphere is lighthearted, nostalgic, warm, comedic, slightly irreverent. bright natural daylight, warm golden hour glow, soft shadows, slightly overexposed highlights, sunlight streaming through windows. The color palette features warm and saturated, golden yellows, soft oranges, blue skies, green grass, the warm tones of late 90s film stock.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
Shot on 35mm film with natural bokeh and gentle lens flares from sunlight.
The photographic quality is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level, 35mm lens. subtle film grain, warm color grading, natural lens flare, soft focus backgrounds

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- dark or gritty
- horror or scary
- cartoon or animated
- anime or manga
- noir or high contrast
- cold blue tones
- dystopian or bleak
- overly stylized or artificial
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- modern smartphones or post-2005 technology
- harsh unflattering lighting
