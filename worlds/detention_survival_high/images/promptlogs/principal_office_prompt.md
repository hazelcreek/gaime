# Image Prompt: Principal Skinner's Office

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Principal Skinner's Office

Scene Description:
A cramped office dominated by an imposing mahogany desk piled high with paperwork and confiscated items. To the south, the frosted glass door leads back to the relative safety of the main hallway.
The walls are institutional beige, decorated with framed diplomas, motivational quotes, and an oil painting of the school mascot - a confused-looking badger. Filing cabinets line one wall, their drawers labeled with years of detention records.
The fluorescent light buzzes overhead, and the carpet shows the wear pattern of a thousand students shuffling nervously. A dying plant wilts on the windowsill. A jar of confiscated phones sits prominently in view.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Mahogany Desk: Covered in confiscation forms.
- Mascot Portrait: The eyes seem to follow you.
- Visible pathway behind: The door back to the main hallway and relative safety, leading to The Main Hallway
- 'DENIED' Stamp sits on the mahogany desk beside a towering stack of confiscation forms, its red ink pad still fresh
- Principal Skinner, The Antagonist, sits behind the massive desk, fingers steepled, peering at you over his reading glasses with barely contained suspicion

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A quintessential American public high school frozen in the late 1990s/early 2000s, all institutional architecture and accidental nostalgia. The building is red brick exterior with aluminum-frame windows, fluorescent-lit hallways, and that specific shade of institutional beige on every wall.
The color palette features locker-gray, linoleum-tan, trophy-case gold, and the orange-tinted afternoon sunlight that streams through every window at 4 PM. Accents include hand-painted spirit banners, faded motivational posters, and outdated safety notices.
Materials include cold metal lockers, sticky cafeteria tables, scuffed gymnasium floors of honey-colored hardwood, and the eternal linoleum that remembers every sneaker that ever squeaked across it.
Environmental details include trophy cases full of participation awards, bulletin boards with outdated announcements, water fountains that never have enough pressure, and vending machines glowing in alcoves. The ceiling tiles are that perforated acoustic type, some stained by ancient leaks.
The lighting is harsh fluorescent with that characteristic buzz, except where late afternoon sun creates golden shafts through dusty windows. The aesthetic is John Hughes meets detention - simultaneously nostalgic and oppressive.
Background extras would include abandoned backpacks, forgotten hall passes, and the evidence of student life just departed - erasers on desks, gum under tables, and doodles on every available surface.

World Context: High School Comedy, Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Mood: The atmosphere is lighthearted, nostalgic, warm, comedic, slightly irreverent. bright natural daylight, warm golden hour glow, soft shadows, slightly overexposed highlights, sunlight streaming through windows. The color palette features warm and saturated, golden yellows, soft oranges, blue skies, green grass, the warm tones of late 90s film stock.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
Shot on 35mm film with natural bokeh and gentle lens flares from sunlight.
The photographic quality is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level, 35mm lens. subtle film grain, warm color grading, natural lens flare, soft focus backgrounds
