# Image Prompt: The Cafeteria

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: The Cafeteria
Theme: High School Comedy
Tone: Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Scene Description:
Tables are folded up against the wall. The lingering scent of mystery meat and bleach hangs heavy. Dust motes dance in the light beams hitting the serving station.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance
Objects in the scene: The Spatula of Destiny leans against the stainless steel serving counter, its industrial size suggesting it has flipped a thousand mystery meat patties
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Lunch Lady Doris, The Gatekeeper, stands behind the serving counter with arms crossed, hairnet askew, guarding the kitchen entrance like a gruff sentinel

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
