# Image Prompt: The Gymnasium

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: The Gymnasium
Theme: High School Comedy
Tone: Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Scene Description:
The squeak of sneakers is ghosted into the hardwood floor. It smells of sweat and rubber. The bleachers are retracted, creating a cavernous echo whenever you move.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene
Objects in the scene: Red Rubber Dodgeball sits dead center on the half-court line, as if waiting to deliver childhood trauma to its next victim

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
