# Image Prompt: The Locker Room

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: The Locker Room
Theme: High School Comedy
Tone: Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Scene Description:
Damp, dark, and smelling of Axe body spray. A single shower head drips rhythmically: drip... drip... drip. It's the scariest place in the school.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene
Objects in the scene: Janitor's Key Ring dangle from a hook on locker 13, their massive key ring jangling softly with the building's vibrations

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
