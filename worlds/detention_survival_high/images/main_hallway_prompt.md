This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Main Hallway

Scene Description:
The linoleum floor stretches out endlessly, reflecting the orange glow of the late afternoon sun streaming through the trophy case glass. It's unnervingly quiet, save for the hum of the vending machine. The lockers line the walls like silent metal soldiers.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene; a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene; an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a passage or path leading toward The Front Gate
Objects in the scene: Laminated Hall Pass sits forgotten on a wooden bench beneath the trophy case, its laminated surface catching the afternoon light

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: High School Comedy, Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Mood: The atmosphere is lighthearted, nostalgic, warm, comedic, slightly irreverent. bright natural daylight, warm golden hour glow, soft shadows, slightly overexposed highlights, sunlight streaming through windows. The color palette features warm and saturated, golden yellows, soft oranges, blue skies, green grass, the warm tones of late 90s film stock.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic photography in the style of late 90s teen comedy films like American Pie
and 10 Things I Hate About You. Warm color grading with slightly lifted shadows.
Natural lighting that feels sunny and optimistic. The aesthetic should feel like
a film still from a beloved coming-of-age movie - nostalgic, warm, and inviting.
Shot on 35mm film with natural bokeh and gentle lens flares from sunlight.
The photographic quality is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.
