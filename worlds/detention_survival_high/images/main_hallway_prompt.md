# Image Prompt: The Main Hallway

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: The Main Hallway
Theme: High School Comedy
Tone: Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Scene Description:
The linoleum floor stretches out endlessly, reflecting the orange glow of the late afternoon sun streaming through the trophy case glass. It's unnervingly quiet, save for the hum of the vending machine. The lockers line the walls like silent metal soldiers.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene; a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene; an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a passage or path leading toward The Front Gate
Objects in the scene: Laminated Hall Pass sits forgotten on a wooden bench beneath the trophy case, its laminated surface catching the afternoon light

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
