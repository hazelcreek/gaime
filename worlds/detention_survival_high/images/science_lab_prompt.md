# Image Prompt: The Science Lab

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: The Science Lab
Theme: High School Comedy
Tone: Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Scene Description:
Bunsen burners sit cold on black countertops. A skeleton model in the corner is wearing a tie-dye t-shirt. The periodic table on the wall has several elements spelled wrong.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene
Objects in the scene: Box of Baking Soda sits on the black countertop next to a collection of beakers, its orange box faded from years of science fair volcanoes
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Neil the Science Club President, The Hint Giver, crouches behind the teacher's desk, peeking out nervously, his thick glasses catching the fluorescent light

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
