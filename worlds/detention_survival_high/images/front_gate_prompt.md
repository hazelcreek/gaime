# Image Prompt: The Front Gate

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.

Location: The Front Gate
Theme: High School Comedy
Tone: Awkward, Rebellious, Nostalgic

Scene Description:
The massive chain-link fence stretches tall, topped with rusty barbed wire that's more for show than security. Beyond it, freedom beckons - the empty parking lot, the distant sound of traffic, the sweet promise of a weekend waiting for you. The padlock on the gate glints in the late afternoon sun.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or path leading toward The Main Hallway

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

Style Requirements:
- Digital painting style with rich colors and dramatic lighting
- Painterly, evocative atmosphere suitable for a text adventure game
- First-person perspective as if the player is viewing the scene
- Moody, immersive lighting that matches the tone
- 16:9 widescreen composition
- Detailed environment with depth and atmospheric effects
- Natural integration of doorways, passages, and architectural features that suggest movement possibilities
- Subtle visual storytelling through object placement and environmental details
