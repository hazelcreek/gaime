premise: |
  It's 4:00 PM on a Friday. The final bell rang an hour ago, but you're still here. Why? Because Principal Skinner locked the front gates to keep skateboarders out, and you forgot your backpack in the gym. Now you need to navigate the uncanny silence of an empty high school, avoid the overzealous hall monitor who thinks school never ends, and find a way to escape before the janitor locks the building down for the weekend.
