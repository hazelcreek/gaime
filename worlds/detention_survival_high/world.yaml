visual_setting: |
  A quintessential American public high school frozen in the late 1990s/early 2000s, all institutional architecture and accidental nostalgia. The building is red brick exterior with aluminum-frame windows, fluorescent-lit hallways, and that specific shade of institutional beige on every wall.
  The color palette features locker-gray, linoleum-tan, trophy-case gold, and the orange-tinted afternoon sunlight that streams through every window at 4 PM. Accents include hand-painted spirit banners, faded motivational posters, and outdated safety notices.
  Materials include cold metal lockers, sticky cafeteria tables, scuffed gymnasium floors of honey-colored hardwood, and the eternal linoleum that remembers every sneaker that ever squeaked across it.
  Environmental details include trophy cases full of participation awards, bulletin boards with outdated announcements, water fountains that never have enough pressure, and vending machines glowing in alcoves. The ceiling tiles are that perforated acoustic type, some stained by ancient leaks.
  The lighting is harsh fluorescent with that characteristic buzz, except where late afternoon sun creates golden shafts through dusty windows. The aesthetic is John Hughes meets detention - simultaneously nostalgic and oppressive.
  Background extras would include abandoned backpacks, forgotten hall passes, and the evidence of student life just departed - erasers on desks, gum under tables, and doodles on every available surface.

premise: |
  It's 4:00 PM on a Friday. The final bell rang an hour ago, but you're still here. Why? Because Principal Skinner locked the front gates to keep skateboarders out, and you forgot your backpack in the gym. Now you need to navigate the uncanny silence of an empty high school, avoid the overzealous hall monitor who thinks school never ends, and find a way to escape before the janitor locks the building down for the weekend.

starting_situation: |
  The final bell rang exactly one hour ago. You can still hear its echo in your soul. You were about to leave when you realized - your backpack, with your phone, your keys, your everything - is still in the gym locker room. You went back for it, and that's when you heard the terrible sound: the CLANK of Principal Skinner locking the front gates. Now you're trapped. The clock on the wall reads 4:00 PM. The janitor does his final lockdown at 5:00 PM. You have one hour to find a way out, or you're spending the weekend in academic purgatory.

  narrative: |
    The key slides into the padlock with a satisfying click. You turn it, and the chain falls away with a musical jingle. The gate swings open, and the late afternoon sun hits your face like a blessing from the gods of freedom.

    You step through, your feet touching the parking lot asphalt. Behind you, the school looms like a bad memory. In front of you: FREEDOM. The whole weekend stretches out before you - no homework, no detention, no Principal Skinner's disappointed sighs.

    You take a deep breath of non-institutional air and start walking home. Somewhere in the distance, you swear you can hear the faint sound of a victory guitar riff.

    CONGRATULATIONS - You have escaped Detention Survival High!
