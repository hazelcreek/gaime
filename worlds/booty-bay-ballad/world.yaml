visual_setting: |
  Caribbean port town in the golden age of piracy with a comedic, exaggerated aesthetic. Buildings are constructed from weathered driftwood planks and sun-bleached timbers, with salt-stained brick foundations and roofs patched with canvas, barrel staves, and rusted metal sheets.
  The color palette centers on warm ochres, faded teals, sun-yellowed whites, and murky sea-greens, punctuated by bold pirate-red and gold accents on flags, banners, and painted signs.
  Architecture is ramshackle colonial style with crooked balconies, rope rigging used as railings, and barnacle-encrusted dock posts. Windows are often missing panes, replaced with shutters hanging at odd angles.
  Pirates wear tattered but colorful garb - tricorn hats with bent feathers, bandanas, striped shirts, oversized belt buckles, and mismatched boots. Many sport eyepatches, hook hands, and exaggerated facial hair (or conspicuous lack thereof in honor of No-Beard McGee).
  Environmental details include seagulls perched everywhere, coiled rope piles, stacked barrels and crates, rusty anchors as decoration, and "wanted" posters flapping in the breeze. The lighting is bright Caribbean sunshine with harsh shadows, and the sky is a vibrant blue with fluffy white clouds.
  Everything has a slightly cartoony, exaggerated quality - expressions are dramatic, objects are slightly oversized, and details lean into pirate clichés with a wink.

premise: |
  Booty Bay is a haven for the salty, the silly, and the suspiciously unwashed. You are on the hunt for Captain 'No-Beard' McGee's legendary treasure, the Golden Parrot, said to be hidden beneath the island's very foundations. But you aren't the only one looking. Rival pirates, incompetent guards, and a very rude seagull stand in your way.

starting_situation: |
  It's high noon, and the tide is turning. The Town Crier just announced that the annual 'Clean Up the Bay' initiative has accidentally unearthed the first clue to McGee's treasure, sending every pirate in town into a frenzy. You're already late to the party, docked at the pier with an empty pocket and a heart full of greed.

  location: treasure_cave

  narrative: |
    With the Ancient Compass guiding your steps through the dark, damp, and frankly smelly tunnels, you stumble into a cavern glittering with gold! You open the chest. It's filled with dubloons, jewels, and a note from Captain No-Beard admitting he just shaved because it was itchy. You are rich! Rich enough to buy your own ship, or at least a very nice hat.
