# Image Prompt: Ship's Galley

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Ship's Galley

Scene Description:
A cramped below-deck kitchen with low timber ceiling beams blackened by decades of cooking smoke. Above, a narrow wooden hatch with brass handles leads up to the deck, with worn ladder rungs nailed to the wall.
A cast-iron stove squats in the corner, covered in crusty pots and pans of alarming colors. Open shelves line the walls, stocked with unlabeled jars, hardtack biscuits, and suspiciously bulging sacks.
Dirty dishes tower in precarious stacks, and a cutting board displays evidence of crimes against vegetables. Dim light filters through a grimy porthole, illuminating dancing dust motes.
Cockroaches patrol the corners, and a mouse peeks out from behind a flour sack, judging the sanitation.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Flour Sack: A sack in the corner labeled 'Premium Flour'. It is ripped open, revealing pure sawdust inside.
- Visible pathway above: The hatch leading back up to the deck, leading to Deck of The Leaky Tub
- Ladle of Infinite Scooping Stuck into a pot of solidified oatmeal.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: Caribbean port town in the golden age of piracy with a comedic, exaggerated aesthetic. Buildings are constructed from weathered driftwood planks and sun-bleached timbers, with salt-stained brick foundations and roofs patched with canvas, barrel staves, and rusted metal sheets.
The color palette centers on warm ochres, faded teals, sun-yellowed whites, and murky sea-greens, punctuated by bold pirate-red and gold accents on flags, banners, and painted signs.
Architecture is ramshackle colonial style with crooked balconies, rope rigging used as railings, and barnacle-encrusted dock posts. Windows are often missing panes, replaced with shutters hanging at odd angles.
Pirates wear tattered but colorful garb - tricorn hats with bent feathers, bandanas, striped shirts, oversized belt buckles, and mismatched boots. Many sport eyepatches, hook hands, and exaggerated facial hair (or conspicuous lack thereof in honor of No-Beard McGee).
Environmental details include seagulls perched everywhere, coiled rope piles, stacked barrels and crates, rusty anchors as decoration, and "wanted" posters flapping in the breeze. The lighting is bright Caribbean sunshine with harsh shadows, and the sky is a vibrant blue with fluffy white clouds.
Everything has a slightly cartoony, exaggerated quality - expressions are dramatic, objects are slightly oversized, and details lean into pirate clichés with a wink.

World Context: Humorous Pirate Adventure, Silly, satirical, salty

Mood: The atmosphere is nostalgic, adventurous, retro-gaming charm. simplified lighting with clear light/shadow distinction, no smooth gradients. The color palette features limited palette typical of 16-bit era, distinct colors without blending, dithering for transitions.

Visual style (most important): Authentic 16-bit pixel art in the style of classic SNES or Genesis RPGs.
Visible pixels are essential - no anti-aliasing or smoothing. Limited color
palette with dithering techniques for shading. 2D sprite art aesthetic.
The pixel art style is absolutely essential - this should look like a
scene from a classic retro RPG. No smooth gradients or high-resolution details.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: top-down birds-eye view or side-scrolling perspective perspective, wide shot showing tile-based environment from fixed orthographic or isometric. dithering patterns, limited animation frames implied, CRT scanline aesthetic optional

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- 3D rendering or CGI
- photorealistic
- high resolution or smooth shading
- watercolor or traditional painting
- smooth gradients
- anti-aliased edges
- modern HD game graphics
- watermarks or signatures
- smooth color gradients
- anti-aliased edges
- too many colors (keep limited palette)
- modern UI elements
