Location: The Rusty Cutlass Tavern

Scene Description:
A dimly lit tavern interior with low wooden beams draped in tattered flags and fishing nets. Lanterns cast warm pools of amber light across sticky wooden tables scarred with carved initials and knife marks.
The bar runs along one wall, backed by shelves of mismatched bottles in greens, browns, and ambers. Brass nautical instruments hang as decoration alongside mounted fish of dubious taxidermy quality.
To the east, weather-beaten green swinging saloon doors let in slashes of bright Caribbean sunlight from the Town Square. To the north, a heavy burgundy velvet curtain with tarnished brass rings conceals the private backroom.
Roughhewn wooden stools and benches crowd the floor, occupied by silhouetted pirate figures hunched over mugs. Pipe smoke curls toward the ceiling, and playing cards and coins litter every surface.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Shark Head: A taxidermied shark with a suspiciously shiny glint in its mouth.
- Help Wanted Sign: A 'Help Wanted' sign reads: 'Seeking Cook. Must know difference between sawdust and cumin.'
- Visible pathway to the right: Weather-beaten green swinging saloon doors letting in bright sunlight from the Town Square, leading to Town Square
- Visible pathway ahead: A heavy burgundy velvet curtain with tarnished brass rings concealing the private backroom, leading to Tavern Backroom
- Ceramic Parrot Clutched in the hand of Bard Barbarossa, who is currently bowing.
- Bard Barbarossa (Puzzle Gatekeeper), Standing on a table, reciting limericks about scurvy.: A burly pirate with a delicate lute and a beard braided with ribbons.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: Caribbean port town in the golden age of piracy with a comedic, exaggerated aesthetic. Buildings are constructed from weathered driftwood planks and sun-bleached timbers, with salt-stained brick foundations and roofs patched with canvas, barrel staves, and rusted metal sheets.
The color palette centers on warm ochres, faded teals, sun-yellowed whites, and murky sea-greens, punctuated by bold pirate-red and gold accents on flags, banners, and painted signs.
Architecture is ramshackle colonial style with crooked balconies, rope rigging used as railings, and barnacle-encrusted dock posts. Windows are often missing panes, replaced with shutters hanging at odd angles.
Pirates wear tattered but colorful garb - tricorn hats with bent feathers, bandanas, striped shirts, oversized belt buckles, and mismatched boots. Many sport eyepatches, hook hands, and exaggerated facial hair (or conspicuous lack thereof in honor of No-Beard McGee).
Environmental details include seagulls perched everywhere, coiled rope piles, stacked barrels and crates, rusty anchors as decoration, and "wanted" posters flapping in the breeze. The lighting is bright Caribbean sunshine with harsh shadows, and the sky is a vibrant blue with fluffy white clouds.
Everything has a slightly cartoony, exaggerated quality - expressions are dramatic, objects are slightly oversized, and details lean into pirate clichés with a wink.

World Context: Humorous Pirate Adventure, Silly, satirical, salty

Mood: The atmosphere is nostalgic, adventurous, retro-gaming charm. simplified lighting with clear light/shadow distinction, no smooth gradients. The color palette features limited palette typical of 16-bit era, distinct colors without blending, dithering for transitions.

Visual style (most important): Authentic 16-bit pixel art in the style of classic SNES or Genesis RPGs.
Visible pixels are essential - no anti-aliasing or smoothing. Limited color
palette with dithering techniques for shading. 2D sprite art aesthetic.
The pixel art style is absolutely essential - this should look like a
scene from a classic retro RPG. No smooth gradients or high-resolution details.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: top-down birds-eye view or side-scrolling perspective perspective, wide shot showing tile-based environment from fixed orthographic or isometric. dithering patterns, limited animation frames implied, CRT scanline aesthetic optional

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- 3D rendering or CGI
- photorealistic
- high resolution or smooth shading
- watercolor or traditional painting
- smooth gradients
- anti-aliased edges
- modern HD game graphics
- watermarks or signatures
- smooth color gradients
- anti-aliased edges
- too many colors (keep limited palette)
- modern UI elements
