Location: Mid-Air Zipline

Scene Description:
WHEEEEEEEEEE!

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage leading toward Deck of The Leaky Tub

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Humorous Pirate Adventure, Silly, satirical, salty

Mood: The atmosphere is nostalgic, adventurous, retro-gaming charm. simplified lighting with clear light/shadow distinction, no smooth gradients. The color palette features limited palette typical of 16-bit era, distinct colors without blending, dithering for transitions.

Visual style (most important): Authentic 16-bit pixel art in the style of classic SNES or Genesis RPGs.
Visible pixels are essential - no anti-aliasing or smoothing. Limited color
palette with dithering techniques for shading. 2D sprite art aesthetic.
The pixel art style is absolutely essential - this should look like a
scene from a classic retro RPG. No smooth gradients or high-resolution details.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: top-down birds-eye view or side-scrolling perspective perspective, wide shot showing tile-based environment from fixed orthographic or isometric. dithering patterns, limited animation frames implied, CRT scanline aesthetic optional
