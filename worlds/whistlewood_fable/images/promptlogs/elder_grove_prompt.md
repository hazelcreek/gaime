This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Elder Grove

Scene Description:
A sacred clearing at the heart of the Whistlewood, dominated by the Great Singing Oak—an enormous, ancient tree whose trunk is as wide as a cottage. To the south, the path leads back through the whispering woods.
The Oak's bark is deeply furrowed, forming a wise, sleeping face. Its leaves, once vibrant gold and green, are now a uniform, silent grey. The branches spread like protective arms, but no song rises from within.
Around the base, a ring of smaller trees and wildflowers bow inward, as if in perpetual mourning. Motes of grey dust drift in the dim light, waiting for a change.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Great Singing Oak: The massive tree looks like it is holding its breath.
- Visible pathway behind: The path back through the whispering woods, leading to The Whispering Woods
- Elara the Dryad, Guardian of the Oak, fades in and out of existence near the Oak's trunk, looking weeping

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: The Whistlewood is an enchanted forest rendered in a soft, watercolor aesthetic with gentle, bleeding edges and muted, dreamlike colors. Currently, the forest is stuck in a perpetual, chilly twilight, its colors fading to grey.
Flora is whimsical and oversized: giant toadstools, flowers that glow faintly, trees with faces in their bark. Moss carpets everything in soft greens that are slowly draining to grey. Leaves are golden and russet where they still have color.
The creatures are anthropomorphized woodland animals: foxes with clever eyes, grumpy badgers with pocket watches, wise owls, industrious moles. They wear bits of natural clothing—scarves of woven grass, hats made from acorn caps.
Architecture is organic and fairy-tale: houses grown from giant mushrooms, cottages with windows of crystallized sugar, burrows beneath ancient roots. Light comes from fireflies, glowing crystals, and jars of captured moonlight.
The overall mood is gentle melancholy tinged with hope. Even in the grey twilight, there's a sense that warmth and color are just waiting to return if someone brave and kind can restore the song.

World Context: Quaint Fairy Tale, Whimsical, Gentle, Slightly Melancholic

Mood: The atmosphere is dreamy, gentle, contemplative, ethereal. soft and diffused, natural light, gentle shadows without harsh edges. The color palette features soft pastels and muted tones, colors bleeding into each other, white space as breathing room.

Visual style (most important): Traditional watercolor painting aesthetic. Soft edges where colors bleed
and blend naturally. Visible paper texture underneath. Delicate washes of
color with areas of intentional white space. The style should feel hand-painted
and organic, with the beautiful imperfections of real watercolor.
The visual style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. color bleeding, soft vignette, visible brush strokes, paper texture
