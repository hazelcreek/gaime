# Image Prompt: The Elder Grove

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Elder Grove

Scene Description:
The heart of the forest. The Great Singing Oak dominates the view, its leaves grey and silent. The air is heavy with waiting.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows
Characters visible in the scene:

- Elara the Dryad, Guardian of the Oak, fades in and out of existence near the Oak's trunk, looking weeping

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Quaint Fairy Tale, Whimsical, Gentle, Slightly Melancholic

Mood: The atmosphere is dreamy, gentle, contemplative, ethereal. soft and diffused, natural light, gentle shadows without harsh edges. The color palette features soft pastels and muted tones, colors bleeding into each other, white space as breathing room.

Artistic style (most important): Traditional watercolor painting aesthetic. Soft edges where colors bleed
and blend naturally. Visible paper texture underneath. Delicate washes of
color with areas of intentional white space. The style should feel hand-painted
and organic, with the beautiful imperfections of real watercolor.
The artistic style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. color bleeding, soft vignette, visible brush strokes, paper texture

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- photorealistic
- sharp and crisp edges
- digital or CGI
- dark and gritty
- high contrast
- neon or vibrant saturated colors
- anime or cartoon
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- overly sharp details
