# Image Prompt: Mokey's Mushroom Cottage

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Mokey's Mushroom Cottage

Scene Description:
A house grown entirely from a giant red mushroom. The windows are made of crystallized sugar. It smells of cinnamon and sulfur.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene
Objects in the scene: Jar of Moonlight sits on the windowsill, glowing with a soft, pale luminescence
Characters visible in the scene:

- Mokey the Mushroom Witch, Alchemist, stirs a cauldron made of a pumpkin shell, muttering rhymes

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Quaint Fairy Tale, Whimsical, Gentle, Slightly Melancholic

Mood: The atmosphere is dreamy, gentle, contemplative, ethereal. soft and diffused, natural light, gentle shadows without harsh edges. The color palette features soft pastels and muted tones, colors bleeding into each other, white space as breathing room.

Artistic style (most important): Traditional watercolor painting aesthetic. Soft edges where colors bleed
and blend naturally. Visible paper texture underneath. Delicate washes of
color with areas of intentional white space. The style should feel hand-painted
and organic, with the beautiful imperfections of real watercolor.
The artistic style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. color bleeding, soft vignette, visible brush strokes, paper texture

- digital or CGI
- dark and gritty
- high contrast
