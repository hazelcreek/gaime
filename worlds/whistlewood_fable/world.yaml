name: "Whistlewood Fable"
theme: "Quaint Fairy Tale"
visual_setting: |
  The Whistlewood is an enchanted forest rendered in a soft, watercolor aesthetic with gentle, bleeding edges and muted, dreamlike colors. Currently, the forest is stuck in a perpetual, chilly twilight, its colors fading to grey.
  Flora is whimsical and oversized: giant toadstools, flowers that glow faintly, trees with faces in their bark. Moss carpets everything in soft greens that are slowly draining to grey. Leaves are golden and russet where they still have color.
  The creatures are anthropomorphized woodland animals: foxes with clever eyes, grumpy badgers with pocket watches, wise owls, industrious moles. They wear bits of natural clothing—scarves of woven grass, hats made from acorn caps.
  Architecture is organic and fairy-tale: houses grown from giant mushrooms, cottages with windows of crystallized sugar, burrows beneath ancient roots. Light comes from fireflies, glowing crystals, and jars of captured moonlight.
  The overall mood is gentle melancholy tinged with hope. Even in the grey twilight, there's a sense that warmth and color are just waiting to return if someone brave and kind can restore the song.

premise: |
  You are Finnick, a small fox with russet fur and clever eyes, living in the Whistlewood. The Great Singing Oak, which keeps the forest seasons turning, has fallen silent. Without its song, the forest is stuck in an eternal, chilly twilight. The colors are fading, and the fabulous creatures are losing their magic. You must restore the song before the Whistlewood turns grey forever.

starting_situation: |
  For weeks, the brambles surrounding the Elder Grove were impassable, thick with thorns of silence. But this morning, a single sunbeam pierced the grey clouds, causing one patch of brambles to wither just enough for a small fox to squeeze through. Now is your chance to slip out of your burrow area and find out why the Oak sleeps.

  narrative: |
    You place the Golden Acorn into the hollow of the Great Singing Oak. A warm hum vibrates through the bark. Suddenly, a melody bursts forth—a song of sun and rain. The grey lifts, leaves turn emerald and gold, and the forest breathes again. You curl up at the roots, a hero in a fox's skin.
