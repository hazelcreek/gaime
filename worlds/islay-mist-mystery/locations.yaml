  name: "Distillery Courtyard"

    Rain lashes against the grey cobblestones of the Lochindaal Distillery courtyard. The smell of burning peat and salt spray is overwhelming. To the north, the looming shape of the Malt Barn offers shelter. To the east, the administrative wing houses the Manager's Office. A path winds west towards the shoreline and the Sea Caves.
