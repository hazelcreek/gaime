Location: Founder's Statue

Scene Description:
A bronze statue of the distillery founder stands overlooking the bay near the pier. The plinth is covered in moss and Gaelic writing.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Scottish Noir, Distillery Mystery, Celtic Folklore, Atmospheric, Rain-soaked, Tense, Peaty

Mood: The atmosphere is uneasy, somber, ominous, introspective, quietly threatening. naturalistic but uncanny, low sun, long shadows, overcast skies, candle or firelight contrasts. The color palette features muted earth tones—lichen greens, peat browns, bone whites, weathered stone—with restrained warm highlights.

Visual style (most important): Folk noir cinematography blending grounded realism with folkloric unease.
Landscapes appear ordinary but charged with ancestral memory: stone structures,
coastal edges, rural courtyards, and weather-beaten environments shaped by ritual
and labor. Color grading is desaturated and earthy, with subtle warmth introduced
through firelight, lanterns, or interior glow. Composition favors stillness,
symmetry that feels ritualistic, and slow observational framing. Weather—wind,
mist, sea spray—acts as a living presence. Human absence or small figures suggest
inherited guilt, unspoken tradition, and the persistence of the past beneath the
present.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: third-person contemplative perspective, wide or medium-wide shots, static framing from eye level, locked-off or slow drift, no handheld. fine film grain, subtle vignette, sea mist, smoke, drifting birds, organic motion
