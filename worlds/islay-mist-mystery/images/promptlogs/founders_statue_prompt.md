This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Founder's Statue

Scene Description:
A bronze statue of the distillery founder stands overlooking the bay near the pier. The plinth is covered in moss and Gaelic writing.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Scottish Noir, Distillery Mystery, Celtic Folklore, Atmospheric, Rain-soaked, Tense, Peaty

Mood: The atmosphere is gritty, tense, morally ambiguous, cynical. high contrast, harsh shadows, pools of light, venetian blind patterns, neon reflections. The color palette features desaturated with selective color accents, mostly black and white with occasional red or blue highlights.

Visual style (most important): Film noir cinematography. High contrast black and white aesthetic with
selective color accents. Dramatic shadows, chiaroscuro lighting, rain-slicked
surfaces reflecting neon signs. Strong geometric shadows from blinds, railings,
and urban architecture. The visual style is paramount and must evoke classic
1940s-1950s noir cinema.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.
