# Image Prompt: Manager's Office

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Manager's Office

Scene Description:
A cluttered, chaotic office with papers strewn across a large mahogany desk and overflowing onto the floor. To the west, the door leads out to the rain-lashed courtyard. A rusty service elevator door is set into the back wall.
Filing cabinets stand open, their contents rifled through. Framed certificates and old photographs line the walls, some hanging askew. Rain streams down the window.
An old brass lamp casts a warm pool of light on the desk. The chaos feels recent, not habitual. The air smells of stale coffee and anxiety.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Service Elevator: A rusty service dumbwaiter shaft. The call button is dead.
- Framed Photo: It shows two men fighting over a woman on a pier.
- Visible pathway to the left: The door leading out to the rain-lashed courtyard, leading to Distillery Courtyard
- Framed Photograph Sitting prominently on the mahogany desk.
- Fiona Campbell, Distillery Manager, Sitting behind the desk, looking defiant.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A remote Scottish island distillery in perpetual rain and mist, all grey stone, copper stills, and weathered wood. The architecture is Victorian industrial merged with ancient Celtic - stone buildings with moss-covered walls and peaked slate roofs.
The color palette is dominated by rain-grey, whisky amber, copper patina green, and the deep brown of peat. Accents include the golden glow of lamp light through rain-streaked windows and the silver of wet cobblestones.
Materials include rough-hewn granite, whitewashed stone, weathered oak barrels stacked in pyramids, and the gleaming copper of pot stills. Everything is damp, from the air to the ancient wood.
Environmental details include rain lashing against every surface, mist rolling in from the sea, smoke rising from peat kilns, and the distant outline of other islands through the murk. Seabirds wheel and cry.
Lighting is diffuse and grey during the day, warm amber from windows and lanterns at night. The Atlantic storms are ever-present, rain drumming on stone and running in rivulets down walls.
The aesthetic is noir meets Celtic folklore - wet trench coats, standing stones glimpsed through mist, the smell of peat smoke and salt spray, and secrets hidden in cellars older than memory.

World Context: Scottish Noir, Distillery Mystery, Celtic Folklore, Atmospheric, Rain-soaked, Tense, Peaty

Mood: The atmosphere is uneasy, somber, ominous, introspective, quietly threatening. naturalistic but uncanny, low sun, long shadows, overcast skies, candle or firelight contrasts. The color palette features muted earth tones—lichen greens, peat browns, bone whites, weathered stone—with restrained warm highlights.

Visual style (most important): Folk noir cinematography blending grounded realism with folkloric unease.
Landscapes appear ordinary but charged with ancestral memory: stone structures,
coastal edges, rural courtyards, and weather-beaten environments shaped by ritual
and labor. Color grading is desaturated and earthy, with subtle warmth introduced
through firelight, lanterns, or interior glow. Composition favors stillness,
symmetry that feels ritualistic, and slow observational framing. Weather—wind,
mist, sea spray—acts as a living presence. Human absence or small figures suggest
inherited guilt, unspoken tradition, and the persistence of the past beneath the
present.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: third-person contemplative perspective, wide or medium-wide shots, static framing from eye level, locked-off or slow drift, no handheld. fine film grain, subtle vignette, sea mist, smoke, drifting birds, organic motion
