Location: Smuggler's Cove

Scene Description:
A hidden chamber carved from the living rock, dry and sheltered from the storm raging outside. To the south, the pivot door in the "Weeping Wall" leads back to the main sea cave.
Rotting wooden barrels and old crates are stacked high, remnants of centuries of smuggling. The walls are rough-hewn stone, blackened with age and old smoke.
A single oil lantern flickers weakly, casting dancing shadows. The silence is eerie after the roar of the cave. Cobwebs drape the corners, and the air smells of damp earth and very old whisky.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Loose Brick: It looks loose.
- Visible pathway behind: The pivot door leading back to the main cave, leading to The Sea Caves
- 1902 Whisky Tucked behind a false brick in the wall.
- Smuggler's Ledger Resting on top of a dry barrel.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A remote Scottish island distillery in perpetual rain and mist, all grey stone, copper stills, and weathered wood. The architecture is Victorian industrial merged with ancient Celtic - stone buildings with moss-covered walls and peaked slate roofs.
The color palette is dominated by rain-grey, whisky amber, copper patina green, and the deep brown of peat. Accents include the golden glow of lamp light through rain-streaked windows and the silver of wet cobblestones.
Materials include rough-hewn granite, whitewashed stone, weathered oak barrels stacked in pyramids, and the gleaming copper of pot stills. Everything is damp, from the air to the ancient wood.
Environmental details include rain lashing against every surface, mist rolling in from the sea, smoke rising from peat kilns, and the distant outline of other islands through the murk. Seabirds wheel and cry.
Lighting is diffuse and grey during the day, warm amber from windows and lanterns at night. The Atlantic storms are ever-present, rain drumming on stone and running in rivulets down walls.
The aesthetic is noir meets Celtic folklore - wet trench coats, standing stones glimpsed through mist, the smell of peat smoke and salt spray, and secrets hidden in cellars older than memory.

World Context: Scottish Noir, Distillery Mystery, Celtic Folklore, Atmospheric, Rain-soaked, Tense, Peaty

Mood: The atmosphere is uneasy, somber, ominous, introspective, quietly threatening. naturalistic but uncanny, low sun, long shadows, overcast skies, candle or firelight contrasts. The color palette features muted earth tones—lichen greens, peat browns, bone whites, weathered stone—with restrained warm highlights.

Visual style (most important): Folk noir cinematography blending grounded realism with folkloric unease.
Landscapes appear ordinary but charged with ancestral memory: stone structures,
coastal edges, rural courtyards, and weather-beaten environments shaped by ritual
and labor. Color grading is desaturated and earthy, with subtle warmth introduced
through firelight, lanterns, or interior glow. Composition favors stillness,
symmetry that feels ritualistic, and slow observational framing. Weather—wind,
mist, sea spray—acts as a living presence. Human absence or small figures suggest
inherited guilt, unspoken tradition, and the persistence of the past beneath the
present.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: third-person contemplative perspective, wide or medium-wide shots, static framing from eye level, locked-off or slow drift, no handheld. fine film grain, subtle vignette, sea mist, smoke, drifting birds, organic motion

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- explicit fantasy creatures or magic
- high-action or horror spectacle
- urban neon environments
- modern glossy realism
- bright, cheerful color palettes
- overt surrealism or dream logic
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- saturated or vivid colors
- harsh digital sharpening
