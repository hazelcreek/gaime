# Image Prompt: Clockwork Jungle

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Clockwork Jungle

Scene Description:
A dense forest of mechanical trees with iron trunks and solar-panel leaves that angle toward the diffused light. Bronze vines coil around the structures, their surfaces etched with intricate gear patterns, occasionally twitching with internal mechanisms.
To the west, the mechanical foliage opens toward the black sand beach. To the east, a trail of rusted gears leads deeper into the island. To the north, a dark tunnel entrance is carved into the rocky hillside, mine cart tracks disappearing into shadow.
The path is paved with interlocking metal grates, obscured by fallen gear-shaped flowers. Small automata scurry through the underbrush with glowing amber eyes. The constant quiet clicking of hidden mechanisms fills the air.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Visible pathway to the left: The path back through the mechanical foliage to the beach, leading to Soot-Stained Sands
- Visible pathway to the right: A trail of rusted gears leading deeper into the island
- Visible pathway ahead: A dark tunnel entrance carved into the rocky hillside

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A remote island where Victorian-era steam technology has grown wild and organic over decades of abandonment. The dominant materials are oxidized brass, corroded copper, and rusted iron, interwoven with black volcanic rock and dense mechanical vegetation.
The color palette centers on deep brass golds, verdigris greens, rust oranges, and oil-slick iridescence, set against the dark grays of volcanic stone and the deep blue-green of surrounding ocean.
Architecture follows industrial Victorian sensibilities - riveted metal plates, exposed pipes, pressure gauges, and decorative ironwork - but overgrown and reclaimed by mechanical flora. Buildings have domed roofs, porthole windows, and pneumatic tube networks.
Automatons range from small scuttling crabs to humanoid figures in tattered Victorian clothing. Their brass bodies are patinated green, their glass eyes glowing faintly amber, joints leaking wisps of steam.
Environmental details include steam venting from ground pipes, gear-shaped flowers, solar-panel leaves on metal trees, oil pooling in rock crevices, and the constant quiet ticking of clockwork. The light is diffused through an ever-present sea mist, creating a melancholy, golden-hour atmosphere.
Everything has a sense of beautiful decay - elegant engineering slowly surrendering to entropy, still functioning but worn and waiting.

World Context: Steampunk Survival, Melancholy yet Wondrous

Mood: The atmosphere is adventurous, industrious, inventive, wondrous. natural lighting with warm lamp accents, dramatic atmospheric lighting, volumetric light rays, golden hour and blue hour skies. The color palette features rich natural colors - deep greens, ocean blues, sunset oranges, vibrant foliage - with brass gold and copper accents on machinery only.

Visual style (most important): Stylized realism with painterly quality, detailed environments. Nature retains
its natural colors: lush greens, blue skies, turquoise waters, colorful flora.
Victorian steampunk machinery elements (brass, copper, iron, gears, pipes, steam)
integrate with colorful natural surroundings. Mechanical elements are warm-toned
but environments are NOT sepia-graded. Rich color saturation, atmospheric depth.
The visual style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or low angle to emphasize machinery. atmospheric haze, volumetric lighting, steam wisps, metallic reflections on brass

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- modern or contemporary
- neon or cyberpunk
- minimalist or clean
- anime or cartoon
- medieval fantasy
- futuristic sleek technology
- monochromatic sepia or brown color grading
- desaturated or muted colors
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- modern technology (computers, LED lights)
- plastic or modern materials
- overly dark or muddy colors
- uniform brown/sepia filter over entire image
