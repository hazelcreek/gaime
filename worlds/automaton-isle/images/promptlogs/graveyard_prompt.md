# Image Prompt: Memorial of Gears

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Memorial of Gears

Scene Description:
A solemn clearing where rows of deactivated automaton chassis stand upright like metal tombstones, their glass eyes dark, their forms frozen in poses of rest. Verdigris and rust streak their once-gleaming bodies.
To the west, the trail of rusted gears leads back through the clockwork jungle. To the north, imposing iron gates twice a person's height block further passage, their bars thick and decorated with mechanical scrollwork.
At the center, a single human headstone of polished obsidian stands out - an inscription reads "My Beloved Daughter." A stone chess table sits before a statue of the Inventor, whose bronze eyes seem to watch the board. Fallen solar-panel leaves carpet the ground.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Inventor's Statue: A statue of the Inventor overlooks the chess table. Its eyes seem to watch the board.
- Visible pathway to the left: The path back through the clockwork jungle, leading to Clockwork Jungle
- Visible pathway ahead: An imposing iron gate blocking the path northward, leading to Iron Gates
- Deep Blue (Gatekeeper), A multi-armed robot sits motionless before a stone chess table.: An elegant, albeit tarnished, android with a velvet tuxedo jacket.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A remote island where Victorian-era steam technology has grown wild and organic over decades of abandonment. The dominant materials are oxidized brass, corroded copper, and rusted iron, interwoven with black volcanic rock and dense mechanical vegetation.
The color palette centers on deep brass golds, verdigris greens, rust oranges, and oil-slick iridescence, set against the dark grays of volcanic stone and the deep blue-green of surrounding ocean.
Architecture follows industrial Victorian sensibilities - riveted metal plates, exposed pipes, pressure gauges, and decorative ironwork - but overgrown and reclaimed by mechanical flora. Buildings have domed roofs, porthole windows, and pneumatic tube networks.
Automatons range from small scuttling crabs to humanoid figures in tattered Victorian clothing. Their brass bodies are patinated green, their glass eyes glowing faintly amber, joints leaking wisps of steam.
Environmental details include steam venting from ground pipes, gear-shaped flowers, solar-panel leaves on metal trees, oil pooling in rock crevices, and the constant quiet ticking of clockwork. The light is diffused through an ever-present sea mist, creating a melancholy, golden-hour atmosphere.
Everything has a sense of beautiful decay - elegant engineering slowly surrendering to entropy, still functioning but worn and waiting.

World Context: Steampunk Survival, Melancholy yet Wondrous

Mood: The atmosphere is adventurous, industrious, inventive, wondrous. natural lighting with warm lamp accents, dramatic atmospheric lighting, volumetric light rays, golden hour and blue hour skies. The color palette features rich natural colors - deep greens, ocean blues, sunset oranges, vibrant foliage - with brass gold and copper accents on machinery only.

Visual style (most important): Stylized realism with painterly quality, detailed environments. Nature retains
its natural colors: lush greens, blue skies, turquoise waters, colorful flora.
Victorian steampunk machinery elements (brass, copper, iron, gears, pipes, steam)
integrate with colorful natural surroundings. Mechanical elements are warm-toned
but environments are NOT sepia-graded. Rich color saturation, atmospheric depth.
The visual style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or low angle to emphasize machinery. atmospheric haze, volumetric lighting, steam wisps, metallic reflections on brass

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- modern or contemporary
- neon or cyberpunk
- minimalist or clean
- anime or cartoon
- medieval fantasy
- futuristic sleek technology
- monochromatic sepia or brown color grading
- desaturated or muted colors
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- modern technology (computers, LED lights)
- plastic or modern materials
- overly dark or muddy colors
- uniform brown/sepia filter over entire image
