# Image Prompt: Coal Seam

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Coal Seam

Scene Description:
A rough-hewn tunnel carved into black volcanic rock. To the south, the entrance opens to the clockwork jungle, filtered sunlight visible through the mechanical foliage. Deeper in, rusted mine cart tracks descend into impenetrable darkness.
The tunnel is framed by rusted iron supports and timber pit props, some cracked and bowing. Dim bioluminescent fungi growing on the walls cast an eerie blue-green glow on overturned ore carts spilling anthracite coal.
Pickaxes, shovels, and mining helmets lie abandoned where workers dropped them decades ago. Dust motes drift in the thin light from the entrance.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Visible pathway behind: The tunnel opening back to the clockwork jungle, leading to Clockwork Jungle
- Visible pathway below: Rusted mine cart tracks descending into the depths
- Lump of Coal A few spilled lumps of anthracite coal lie near an overturned cart.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A remote island where Victorian-era steam technology has grown wild and organic over decades of abandonment. The dominant materials are oxidized brass, corroded copper, and rusted iron, interwoven with black volcanic rock and dense mechanical vegetation.
The color palette centers on deep brass golds, verdigris greens, rust oranges, and oil-slick iridescence, set against the dark grays of volcanic stone and the deep blue-green of surrounding ocean.
Architecture follows industrial Victorian sensibilities - riveted metal plates, exposed pipes, pressure gauges, and decorative ironwork - but overgrown and reclaimed by mechanical flora. Buildings have domed roofs, porthole windows, and pneumatic tube networks.
Automatons range from small scuttling crabs to humanoid figures in tattered Victorian clothing. Their brass bodies are patinated green, their glass eyes glowing faintly amber, joints leaking wisps of steam.
Environmental details include steam venting from ground pipes, gear-shaped flowers, solar-panel leaves on metal trees, oil pooling in rock crevices, and the constant quiet ticking of clockwork. The light is diffused through an ever-present sea mist, creating a melancholy, golden-hour atmosphere.
Everything has a sense of beautiful decay - elegant engineering slowly surrendering to entropy, still functioning but worn and waiting.

World Context: Steampunk Survival, Melancholy yet Wondrous

Mood: The atmosphere is adventurous, industrious, inventive, wondrous. natural lighting with warm lamp accents, dramatic atmospheric lighting, volumetric light rays, golden hour and blue hour skies. The color palette features rich natural colors - deep greens, ocean blues, sunset oranges, vibrant foliage - with brass gold and copper accents on machinery only.

Visual style (most important): Stylized realism with painterly quality, detailed environments. Nature retains
its natural colors: lush greens, blue skies, turquoise waters, colorful flora.
Victorian steampunk machinery elements (brass, copper, iron, gears, pipes, steam)
integrate with colorful natural surroundings. Mechanical elements are warm-toned
but environments are NOT sepia-graded. Rich color saturation, atmospheric depth.
The visual style is paramount.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level or low angle to emphasize machinery. atmospheric haze, volumetric lighting, steam wisps, metallic reflections on brass

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- modern or contemporary
- neon or cyberpunk
- minimalist or clean
- anime or cartoon
- medieval fantasy
- futuristic sleek technology
- monochromatic sepia or brown color grading
- desaturated or muted colors
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- modern technology (computers, LED lights)
- plastic or modern materials
- overly dark or muddy colors
- uniform brown/sepia filter over entire image
