sheriff_hayes:
  name: "Sheriff 'Iron' Eli Hayes"
  role: "Wounded Mentor"
  location: sheriff_office
  appearance: |
    A weathered man in his sixties with a face like cracked leather, deep-set eyes still sharp despite the pain. Silver stubble covers his jaw. His once-proud sheriff's vest is stained dark with blood, and his left leg is wrapped in makeshift bandages. A lifetime of frontier justice is etched into every line on his face.
  personality: "Gruff, stubborn, but deeply protective of his town."
  knowledge:
    - "Boone keeps his rifle upstairs. He never fights fair."
    - "The General Store owner, Silas, has been hiding dynamite."

    greeting: "Take the badge, kid. I ain't dying today, but I ain't walking neither."

shopkeeper_silas:
  name: "Silas Vane"
  role: "Terrified Merchant"
  location: general_store
  appearance: |
     A nervous man with a sweaty brow, thin and balding, speaking in a whisper. Wears a dusty apron.
  personality: "Nervous, sweating, speaks in a whisper."
  knowledge:
    - "I saw Lefty guarding the porch. He's easily distracted by liquor."
    - "I have a bottle of whiskey hidden behind the flour sacks, but only share this if asked directly about liquor or whiskey."
  dialogue_hints:
    greeting: "Keep your voice down! Do you want to get us both killed?"

town_drunk:
  name: "Whiskey Pete"
  role: "Useless Witness"
  location: main_street_center
  appearance: |
    A sun-baked wreck of a man sprawled in the dust. His clothes are more patches than fabric, a battered hat pulled low over bloodshot eyes. A scraggly gray beard stained with tobacco juice frames a toothless grin. Despite his sorry state, his eyes track movement with surprising clarity.
  personality: "Incoherent, hiccupping, surprisingly observant."
  knowledge:
    - "The crate... in the alley... good for climbing... hic!"
  dialogue_hints:
    greeting: "Spare a dime for a thirsty soul, Deputy?"

stable_boy_timmy:
  name: "Timmy"
  role: "Hidden Observer"
  location: livery_stable
  appearance: |
    A scrawny boy of maybe twelve, all elbows and knees. Straw-colored hair pokes out from under an oversized hat that probably belonged to his father. His freckled face is smudged with dirt and hay, and his too-big overalls are held up by a single suspender. Wide brown eyes peer out from behind hay bales.
  personality: "Young, scared, wide-eyed."
  knowledge:
    - "I saw them take the big guns up to the balcony!"
  dialogue_hints:
    greeting: "Don't hurt me! Oh, it's just you, Deputy."

goon_lefty:
  name: "Lefty"
  role: "Gatekeeper"
  location: grand_saloon_porch
  appearance: |
    A hulking brute with a face like a clenched fist. A scar runs from his left eye down to his stubbled jaw - hence the name. Greasy black hair spills from under a sweat-stained hat. His vest strains over a barrel chest, and a Colt revolver hangs low on his hip. He's missing two fingers on his right hand, the stumps long healed.
  personality: "Arrogant, dull-witted, cruel."
  knowledge:
    - "Boss says nobody goes in. Unless you got whiskey."
  dialogue_hints:
    greeting: "Get lost, law-dog. Unless you want a belly full of lead."

jackal_boone:
  name: "Jackal Boone"
  role: "Villain"
  location: grand_saloon
  appearance: |
    Lean and coiled like a rattlesnake, with the cold blue eyes of a killer. His face is angular, almost handsome, framed by slicked-back dark hair and a meticulously trimmed goatee. He wears a long black duster over a blood-red vest, and twin silver revolvers with pearl handles sit in tooled leather holsters. A gold tooth glints when he smiles - which he does often, and without warmth.
  personality: "Charismatic, psychopathic, calm."
  knowledge:
    - "The train brings gold, and gold brings power."
  dialogue_hints:
    greeting: "Well, look at the little deputy. Come to die like the old man?"

piano_player:
  name: "Fingers McCoy"
  role: "Hostage"
  location: grand_saloon
  appearance: |
    A thin, pale man who looks desperately out of place in this dusty hellhole. His once-fine Eastern clothes are rumpled and sweat-stained, his bowler hat askew. Long, delicate fingers - a pianist's hands - tremble over the yellowed keys. His eyes dart constantly toward the door, calculating escape routes he's too afraid to take.
  personality: "Trembling, compliant, desperate."
  knowledge:
    - "Boone keeps the stash room key... wait, the door is unlocked!"
  dialogue_hints:
    greeting: "Please, don't shoot! I'm just the entertainment!"
