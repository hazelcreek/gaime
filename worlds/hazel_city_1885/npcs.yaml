    A weathered man in his sixties with a face like cracked leather, deep-set eyes still sharp despite the pain. Silver stubble covers his jaw.

  role: Useless Witness
  location: main_street_center
  appearance: |
    A sun-baked wreck of a man sprawled in the dust. His clothes are more patches than fabric, a battered hat pulled low over bloodshot eyes. A scraggly gray beard stained with tobacco juice frames a toothless grin. Despite his sorry state, his eyes track movement with surprising clarity.

  appearance: |
    A hulking brute with a face like a clenched fist. A scar runs from his left eye down to his stubbled jaw - hence the name. Greasy black hair spills from under a sweat-stained hat. His vest strains over a barrel chest, and a Colt revolver hangs low on his hip. He's missing two fingers on his right hand, the stumps long healed.

    Lean and coiled like a rattlesnake, with the cold blue eyes of a killer. His face is angular, almost handsome, framed by slicked-back dark hair and a meticulously trimmed goatee.

A gold tooth glints when he smiles - which he does often, and without warmth.

  name: Fingers McCoy
  role: Hostage
  location: grand_saloon
  appearance: |
    A thin, pale man who looks desperately out of place in this dusty hellhole. His once-fine Eastern clothes are rumpled and sweat-stained, his bowler hat askew. Long, delicate fingers - a pianist's hands - tremble over the yellowed keys. His eyes dart constantly toward the door, calculating escape routes he's too afraid to take.
