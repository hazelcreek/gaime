# Image Prompt: Main Street (South)

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Main Street (South)

Scene Description:
The sun beats down on the packed dirt road. Tumbleweeds actually roll past, cliche as it is. To the south is the Sheriff's Office. To the north, the street continues toward the Saloon. To the east lies the General Store.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Spaghetti Western, Gritty, tense, sun-bleached

Mood: The atmosphere is tense, operatic, sun-baked, morally ambiguous, stoic, fatalistic. harsh midday sun casting deep black shadows, silhouettes against blazing sky, golden dust motes floating in shafts of light, dark interiors with slits of blinding daylight. The color palette features sun-bleached earth tones, dusty ochre and sienna, burnt orange sunsets, weathered browns, occasional blood red, deep shadows approaching black, washed-out blues for distant sky.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic style faithfully recreating 1960s Italian Spaghetti Western films, 
specifically evoking Sergio Leone's visual language. Techniscope widescreen 
framing with extreme depth of field. Harsh desert lighting creates stark 
contrast between blinding sun and pitch-black shadows. Every surface is 
weathered, dusty, and sun-damaged - cracked wood, rusted metal, sweat-stained 
leather. Visible dust particles drift through sunbeams. Heat shimmer distorts 
distant horizons. Faces are lined, stubbled, sun-darkened. The artistic style 
is paramount and must evoke the gritty authenticity of The Good, The Bad and 
The Ugly, For a Few Dollars More, and Once Upon a Time in the West.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, extreme wide establishing shots or dramatic medium close-ups emphasizing eyes from eye level or low angle looking up for dramatic tension, occasional extreme close-ups. film grain, dust particles suspended in air, heat haze on horizons, lens flare from harsh sun, slight color desaturation, vignette

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- modern or contemporary elements
- lush green landscapes or vegetation
- anime, cartoon, or stylized illustration
- dark gothic or horror lighting
- futuristic or science fiction
- clean, polished, or pristine surfaces
- rainy, wet, or overcast weather
- bright saturated colors
- soft romantic lighting
- American Hollywood Western glamour
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- anachronistic elements (cars, electricity, modern clothing)
- green grass or lush vegetation
- cold blue or purple lighting
- pristine or new-looking objects
- clean-shaven, well-groomed characters
