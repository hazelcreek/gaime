# Image Prompt: Saloon Porch

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Saloon Porch

Scene Description:
The wooden planks creak underfoot. Laughter and piano music spill from inside, sounding menacingly cheerful given the town's plight. A 'Wanted' poster flutters on a pillar.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene
Objects in the scene: Boone Wanted Poster is nailed to a support beam, flapping in the hot wind
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Lefty (Gatekeeper), leans against the wall, whittling a stick with a large knife: A hulking brute with a face like a clenched fist. A scar runs from his left eye down to his stubbled jaw - hence the name. Greasy black hair spills from under a sweat-stained hat. His vest strains over a barrel chest, and a Colt revolver hangs low on his hip. He's missing two fingers on his right hand, the stumps long healed.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Spaghetti Western, Gritty, tense, sun-bleached

Mood: The atmosphere is tense, operatic, sun-baked, morally ambiguous, stoic, fatalistic. harsh midday sun casting deep black shadows, silhouettes against blazing sky, golden dust motes floating in shafts of light, dark interiors with slits of blinding daylight. The color palette features sun-bleached earth tones, dusty ochre and sienna, burnt orange sunsets, weathered browns, occasional blood red, deep shadows approaching black, washed-out blues for distant sky.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic style faithfully recreating 1960s Italian Spaghetti Western films,
specifically evoking Sergio Leone's visual language. Techniscope widescreen
framing with extreme depth of field. Harsh desert lighting creates stark
contrast between blinding sun and pitch-black shadows. Every surface is
weathered, dusty, and sun-damaged - cracked wood, rusted metal, sweat-stained
leather. Visible dust particles drift through sunbeams. Heat shimmer distorts
distant horizons. Faces are lined, stubbled, sun-darkened. The artistic style
is paramount and must evoke the gritty authenticity of The Good, The Bad and
The Ugly, For a Few Dollars More, and Once Upon a Time in the West.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, extreme wide establishing shots or dramatic medium close-ups emphasizing eyes from eye level or low angle looking up for dramatic tension, occasional extreme close-ups. film grain, dust particles suspended in air, heat haze on horizons, lens flare from harsh sun, slight color desaturation, vignette
