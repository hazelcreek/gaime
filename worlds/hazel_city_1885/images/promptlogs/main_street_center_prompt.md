Location: Main Street (Center)

Scene Description:
The heart of Hazel City's main street, the packed dirt widening slightly. To the south, the dusty road leads back toward the Sheriff's Office. To the north, the Grand Saloon's weathered bat-wing doors swing, tinny piano music drifting out.
To the west, the open barn doors of the Livery Stable smell of horses and hay. A wooden water trough sits cracked and bone-dry, and a vulture perches on a nearby hitching post.
The noon sun casts almost no shadows, leaving everything bleached and exposed. The Saloon dominates the view - two stories of weathered wood. A distant train whistle carries on the wind.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Water Trough: Bone dry. It hasn't rained in weeks.
- Visible pathway behind: The dusty road back toward the Sheriff's Office, leading to Main Street (South)
- Visible pathway ahead: The weathered bat-wing doors of the Grand Saloon, music drifting out, leading to Saloon Porch
- Visible pathway to the left: The open barn doors of the Livery Stable, smelling of horses and hay, leading to Livery Stable
- Whiskey Pete (Useless Witness), lies passed out in the shadow of the water trough: A sun-baked wreck of a man sprawled in the dust. His clothes are more patches than fabric, a battered hat pulled low over bloodshot eyes. A scraggly gray beard stained with tobacco juice frames a toothless grin. Despite his sorry state, his eyes track movement with surprising clarity.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A quintessential 1880s Arizona frontier town, all sun-bleached wood and dust, baking under a merciless high-noon sun. The architecture is classic American West - false-fronted wooden buildings, covered boardwalks, hitching posts, and water troughs.
The color palette is dominated by bleached tans, dusty browns, weathered gray wood, and the harsh white of the desert sun. Accents come from painted signs, the red of rust, and occasional splashes of faded color on fabric and posters.
Materials include rough-hewn lumber, adobe, and sun-baked earth. Everything is coated in a fine layer of dust, and the streets are packed dirt showing the tracks of horses and wagon wheels.
Environmental details include tumbleweeds actually tumbling, heat shimmer rising from the road, horses tied to posts switching their tails against flies, and vultures circling in the distance. The sun casts harsh shadows and bleaches everything.
Lighting is brutally bright - the harsh overhead sun of high noon, creating stark shadows under awnings and in doorways. The sky is vast and cloudless, an oppressive pale blue.
Character dress includes dusters, wide-brimmed hats, bandanas, and worn leather boots. Everything is dusty, sun-faded, and practical for desert life.

World Context: Spaghetti Western, Gritty, tense, sun-bleached

Mood: The atmosphere is tense, operatic, sun-baked, morally ambiguous, stoic, fatalistic. harsh midday sun casting deep black shadows, silhouettes against blazing sky, golden dust motes floating in shafts of light, dark interiors with slits of blinding daylight. The color palette features sun-bleached earth tones, dusty ochre and sienna, burnt orange sunsets, weathered browns, occasional blood red, deep shadows approaching black, washed-out blues for distant sky.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic style faithfully recreating 1960s Italian Spaghetti Western films,
specifically evoking Sergio Leone's visual language. Techniscope widescreen
framing with extreme depth of field. Harsh desert lighting creates stark
contrast between blinding sun and pitch-black shadows. Every surface is
weathered, dusty, and sun-damaged - cracked wood, rusted metal, sweat-stained
leather. Visible dust particles drift through sunbeams. Heat shimmer distorts
distant horizons. Faces are lined, stubbled, sun-darkened. The visual style
is paramount and must evoke the gritty authenticity of The Good, The Bad and
The Ugly, For a Few Dollars More, and Once Upon a Time in the West.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, extreme wide establishing shots or dramatic medium close-ups emphasizing eyes from eye level or low angle looking up for dramatic tension, occasional extreme close-ups. film grain, dust particles suspended in air, heat haze on horizons, lens flare from harsh sun, slight color desaturation, vignette
