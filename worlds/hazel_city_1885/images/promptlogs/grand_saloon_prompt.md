# Image Prompt: The Grand Saloon

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: The Grand Saloon

Scene Description:
Smoke hangs in the air like a thick fog. The piano player stops abruptly as you enter. Tables are overturned, save for the large poker table in the center where the gang holds court.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; stairs leading upward, or a visible upper level or balcony
Objects in the scene: Glass of Whiskey sits abandoned on a sticky table near the door
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Jackal Boone (Villain), sits at the center table, cleaning a massive revolver: Lean and coiled like a rattlesnake, with the cold blue eyes of a killer. His face is angular, almost handsome, framed by slicked-back dark hair and a meticulously trimmed goatee. He wears a long black duster over a blood-red vest, and twin silver revolvers with pearl handles sit in tooled leather holsters. A gold tooth glints when he smiles - which he does often, and without warmth. A figure - Fingers McCoy (Hostage), freezes at the keys of the upright piano in the corner: A thin, pale man who looks desperately out of place in this dusty hellhole. His once-fine Eastern clothes are rumpled and sweat-stained, his bowler hat askew. Long, delicate fingers - a pianist's hands - tremble over the yellowed keys. His eyes dart constantly toward the door, calculating escape routes he's too afraid to take.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Spaghetti Western, Gritty, tense, sun-bleached

Mood: The atmosphere is tense, operatic, sun-baked, morally ambiguous, stoic, fatalistic. harsh midday sun casting deep black shadows, silhouettes against blazing sky, golden dust motes floating in shafts of light, dark interiors with slits of blinding daylight. The color palette features sun-bleached earth tones, dusty ochre and sienna, burnt orange sunsets, weathered browns, occasional blood red, deep shadows approaching black, washed-out blues for distant sky.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic style faithfully recreating 1960s Italian Spaghetti Western films, 
specifically evoking Sergio Leone's visual language. Techniscope widescreen 
framing with extreme depth of field. Harsh desert lighting creates stark 
contrast between blinding sun and pitch-black shadows. Every surface is 
weathered, dusty, and sun-damaged - cracked wood, rusted metal, sweat-stained 
leather. Visible dust particles drift through sunbeams. Heat shimmer distorts 
distant horizons. Faces are lined, stubbled, sun-darkened. The artistic style 
is paramount and must evoke the gritty authenticity of The Good, The Bad and 
The Ugly, For a Few Dollars More, and Once Upon a Time in the West.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, extreme wide establishing shots or dramatic medium close-ups emphasizing eyes from eye level or low angle looking up for dramatic tension, occasional extreme close-ups. film grain, dust particles suspended in air, heat haze on horizons, lens flare from harsh sun, slight color desaturation, vignette
