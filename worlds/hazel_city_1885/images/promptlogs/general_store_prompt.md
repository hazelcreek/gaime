# Image Prompt: Mercantile & Goods

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Mercantile & Goods

Scene Description:
It's cooler in here, smelling of dry grain and peppermint. Shelves are stocked with canned peaches and bolts of fabric, but the ammunition shelf is suspiciously empty.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene
Objects in the scene: Stick of Dynamite is tucked almost out of sight behind a jar of pickled eggs
Barely perceptible elements: something barely visible that could be whiskey bottle, perhaps catching a sliver of light or partially obscured
Characters visible in the scene: A figure - Silas Vane (Terrified Merchant), nervously polishes the counter, eyes darting to the door: A nervous man with a sweaty brow, thin and balding, speaking in a whisper. Wears a dusty apron.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Spaghetti Western, Gritty, tense, sun-bleached

Mood: The atmosphere is tense, operatic, sun-baked, morally ambiguous, stoic, fatalistic. harsh midday sun casting deep black shadows, silhouettes against blazing sky, golden dust motes floating in shafts of light, dark interiors with slits of blinding daylight. The color palette features sun-bleached earth tones, dusty ochre and sienna, burnt orange sunsets, weathered browns, occasional blood red, deep shadows approaching black, washed-out blues for distant sky.

Artistic style (most important): Cinematic style faithfully recreating 1960s Italian Spaghetti Western films,
specifically evoking Sergio Leone's visual language. Techniscope widescreen
framing with extreme depth of field. Harsh desert lighting creates stark
contrast between blinding sun and pitch-black shadows. Every surface is
weathered, dusty, and sun-damaged - cracked wood, rusted metal, sweat-stained
leather. Visible dust particles drift through sunbeams. Heat shimmer distorts
distant horizons. Faces are lined, stubbled, sun-darkened. The artistic style
is paramount and must evoke the gritty authenticity of The Good, The Bad and
The Ugly, For a Few Dollars More, and Once Upon a Time in the West.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, extreme wide establishing shots or dramatic medium close-ups emphasizing eyes from eye level or low angle looking up for dramatic tension, occasional extreme close-ups. film grain, dust particles suspended in air, heat haze on horizons, lens flare from harsh sun, slight color desaturation, vignette
