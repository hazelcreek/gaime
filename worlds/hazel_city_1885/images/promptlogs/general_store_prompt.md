Location: Mercantile & Goods

Scene Description:
A cluttered mercantile with floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves packed with frontier necessities - canned goods, bolts of fabric, mining equipment. To the west, the bright doorway leads back to the sweltering street.
A long wooden counter runs across the back, its surface worn smooth by countless transactions. Glass jars of penny candy line the counter, and a brass scale sits ready. The ammunition shelf is conspicuously empty.
Barrels of flour, sugar, and pickles cluster near the entrance. The air is cooler here, shaded from the brutal sun. Light filters through a dusty front window, illuminating floating dust motes.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Store Shelves: Most essentials are here, but the gun powder and bullets have been raided.
- Flour Sacks: Heavy burlap sacks of flour stacked on the back shelves.
- Visible pathway to the left: The bright rectangle of the doorway leading back to the sweltering street, leading to Main Street (South)
- Stick of Dynamite is tucked almost out of sight behind a jar of pickled eggs
- Silas Vane (Terrified Merchant), nervously polishes the counter, eyes darting to the door: A nervous man with a sweaty brow, thin and balding, speaking in a whisper. Wears a dusty apron.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: A quintessential 1880s Arizona frontier town, all sun-bleached wood and dust, baking under a merciless high-noon sun. The architecture is classic American West - false-fronted wooden buildings, covered boardwalks, hitching posts, and water troughs.
The color palette is dominated by bleached tans, dusty browns, weathered gray wood, and the harsh white of the desert sun. Accents come from painted signs, the red of rust, and occasional splashes of faded color on fabric and posters.
Materials include rough-hewn lumber, adobe, and sun-baked earth. Everything is coated in a fine layer of dust, and the streets are packed dirt showing the tracks of horses and wagon wheels.
Environmental details include tumbleweeds actually tumbling, heat shimmer rising from the road, horses tied to posts switching their tails against flies, and vultures circling in the distance. The sun casts harsh shadows and bleaches everything.
Lighting is brutally bright - the harsh overhead sun of high noon, creating stark shadows under awnings and in doorways. The sky is vast and cloudless, an oppressive pale blue.
Character dress includes dusters, wide-brimmed hats, bandanas, and worn leather boots. Everything is dusty, sun-faded, and practical for desert life.

World Context: Spaghetti Western, Gritty, tense, sun-bleached

Mood: The atmosphere is tense, operatic, sun-baked, morally ambiguous, stoic, fatalistic. harsh midday sun casting deep black shadows, silhouettes against blazing sky, golden dust motes floating in shafts of light, dark interiors with slits of blinding daylight. The color palette features sun-bleached earth tones, dusty ochre and sienna, burnt orange sunsets, weathered browns, occasional blood red, deep shadows approaching black, washed-out blues for distant sky.

Visual style (most important): Cinematic style faithfully recreating 1960s Italian Spaghetti Western films,
specifically evoking Sergio Leone's visual language. Techniscope widescreen
framing with extreme depth of field. Harsh desert lighting creates stark
contrast between blinding sun and pitch-black shadows. Every surface is
weathered, dusty, and sun-damaged - cracked wood, rusted metal, sweat-stained
leather. Visible dust particles drift through sunbeams. Heat shimmer distorts
distant horizons. Faces are lined, stubbled, sun-darkened. The visual style
is paramount and must evoke the gritty authenticity of The Good, The Bad and
The Ugly, For a Few Dollars More, and Once Upon a Time in the West.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, extreme wide establishing shots or dramatic medium close-ups emphasizing eyes from eye level or low angle looking up for dramatic tension, occasional extreme close-ups. film grain, dust particles suspended in air, heat haze on horizons, lens flare from harsh sun, slight color desaturation, vignette
