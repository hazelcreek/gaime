  Hazel City, Arizona, 1885. The Red Jackal Gang has strangled the life out of this frontier town. Sheriff 'Iron' Eli Hayes is the only law left, but he's old and outgunned. The gang's leader, Jackal Boone, has taken over the Saloon and is planning to rob the incoming Union Pacific shipment at noon.

  You are the Sheriff's newly appointed (and only) deputy. Sheriff Hayes was wounded in a shootout this morning and is currently holed up in his office. He can't walk, let alone fight.
