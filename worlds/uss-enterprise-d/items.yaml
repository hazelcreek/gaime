combadge:
  name: "Starfleet Combadge"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A small Starfleet delta worn at the chest. It is deceptively simple: communicator, locator,
    and symbol. A single tap can connect you to the ship's voice — and to its expectations.
  scene_description: "Your combadge sits at your chest, ready to connect you to the ship"
  take_description: "It's already clipped to your uniform"

cadet_padd:
  name: "Cadet PADD"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A Starfleet-issued PADD preloaded with your duty schedule, training modules, and the kind of
    procedural checklists that feel dull right up until they save a life.
  scene_description: "A Starfleet PADD is in your hand, its LCARS interface awaiting input"
  take_description: "You secure the PADD in your hand"

starfleet_field_manual:
  name: "Starfleet Field Manual"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A compact manual of principles and practice: emergency protocols, ethical guidelines, and
    reminders that procedure exists to protect people, not to replace thinking.
  scene_description: "Your field manual is tucked neatly in your kit, well-thumbed already"
  take_description: "You already have the manual"

academy_commencement_pin:
  name: "Academy Commencement Pin"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A small metal pin issued at graduation: understated, a little old-fashioned, and strangely heavy
    for its size. The design is simple — Starfleet delta over the Academy seal — but the meaning is
    personal. It reminds you of sleepless nights, impossible exams, and the moment you realized that
    competence isn't the same thing as confidence.
  scene_description: "A small Academy pin is secured to your kit, more sentimental than practical"
  take_description: "It's already yours — you keep it close without thinking"

family_holochip:
  name: "Family Holochip"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A tiny holochip containing a short message from home: awkward encouragement, ordinary affection,
    and the quiet faith that you'll be fine even if you're terrified. It's the kind of thing you
    would never admit helps — which is exactly why it does.
  scene_description: "A small holochip sits in your pocket, warm from your body heat"
  take_description: "You already have it"

tricorder:
  name: "Tricorder"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A standard Starfleet tricorder: sensors, diagnostics, and analysis in a handheld frame.
    It can't replace judgment — but it can turn vague suspicion into measurable truth.
  scene_description: "A tricorder rests in a wall-mounted diagnostic cradle"
  take_description: "You lift the tricorder from its cradle, feeling its familiar weight"

insulated_gloves:
  name: "Insulated Gloves"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    Thick, flexible gloves designed to protect hands from heat and electrical discharge.
    They smell faintly of polymer and the last emergency they were used in.
  scene_description: "A pair of insulated gloves sits in an emergency kit compartment"
  take_description: "You pull on the insulated gloves, flexing your fingers to test the fit"

briefing_padd:
  name: "Briefing PADD"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A PADD prepared for a senior staff briefing. It contains a concise incident summary template:
    observations, hypotheses, actions taken, and ethical considerations — as if the ship expects
    every technical problem to have a moral shadow.
  scene_description: "A PADD set aside for the next briefing rests on a side console"
  take_description: "You take the briefing PADD, careful not to smudge its pristine screen"

engineering_access_padd:
  name: "Engineering Access PADD"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A temporary authorization PADD tagged to Engineering protocols. The permissions are narrow and
    time-limited: just enough to do necessary work, not enough to do something irreversible.
  scene_description: "A temporary Engineering access PADD is secured near Ops, flagged for incident use"
  take_description: "You take the Engineering access PADD; its permissions authenticate with a soft chime"

engineering_toolkit:
  name: "Engineering Toolkit"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A compact kit of precision tools: field spanners, diagnostic leads, an isolinear contact brush,
    and a small graviton clamp. It's the kind of kit that says: problems can be solved by hands and
    patience, not just by heroics.
  scene_description: "An engineering toolkit sits open on a console, tools neatly slotted"
  take_description: "You secure the toolkit, double-checking each tool is locked in place"

replacement_isolinear_chip:
  name: "Replacement Isolinear Chip"
  portable: true
  # V3: hidden and find_condition moved to locations.yaml item_placements
  examine_description: |
    A slim, durable isolinear chip: logic pathways etched into matter. It looks unimpressive until
    you remember it can change how an entire ship thinks about power.
  scene_description: "A replacement isolinear chip rests in foam inside a labeled storage drawer"
  take_description: "You take the replacement isolinear chip and close the drawer carefully"

plasma_injector_regulator:
  name: "Plasma Injector Regulator"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A specialized regulator used to smooth plasma flow fluctuations. In the wrong hands it's a
    hazard; in the right hands it's a quiet promise that systems can be brought back into harmony.
  scene_description: "A plasma injector regulator is secured in a diagnostic cradle by the control panel"
  take_description: "You detach the regulator from its cradle, mindful of its calibration"

phase_inverter:
  name: "Phase Inverter"
  portable: true
  # V3: hidden and find_condition moved to locations.yaml item_placements
  examine_description: |
    A compact engineering component used to invert and cancel phase-aligned feedback. It's a
    deceptively simple answer to a complex problem: meet the loop with its own mirror.
  scene_description: "A phase inverter is clipped to a maintenance strap near a junction box"
  take_description: "You unclip the phase inverter and stow it securely"

holodeck_safety_key:
  name: "Holodeck Safety Key"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A physical interlock key for holodeck safety systems. It's old-fashioned on purpose: a reminder
    that some safeguards should exist beyond software — beyond persuasion — beyond error.
  scene_description: "A physical safety key sits recessed in the holodeck arch's interlock slot"
  take_description: "You carefully remove the safety key and keep it close"

data_crystal:
  name: "High-Density Data Crystal"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A storage crystal designed for secure, high-fidelity archival: not just data, but patterns of
    behavior, memory states, and contextual metadata. In other words: a chance to preserve something
    without letting it roam.
  scene_description: "A padded case contains a high-density data crystal, kept ready for careful use"
  take_description: "You take the data crystal case, as if handling a fragile moral argument"

hypospray:
  name: "Hypospray"
  portable: true
  examine_description: |
    A medical hypospray — compact, precise, and intentionally non-intimidating. It can deliver a
    dose with minimal discomfort. Even its design suggests that care should not feel like force.
  scene_description: "A hypospray rests on a sterilized tray beside a biobed"
  take_description: "You take the hypospray, careful to keep it sterile"

synthcoffee:
  name: "Synthehol Coffee"
  portable: false
  examine_description: |
    A warm cup that smells like coffee and tastes like a convincing attempt at comfort. It won't
    solve the problem, but it might steady your hands long enough to solve it yourself.
  scene_description: "A cup of synthehol coffee steams quietly on a nearby table"
  take_description: "You carry it carefully, trying not to spill"

earl_grey_tea:
  name: "Earl Grey Tea"
  portable: false
  examine_description: |
    Hot tea, fragrant and calm. It tastes like civilization insisting on itself, even when the ship
    is under strain.
  scene_description: "A cup of tea sits steaming beside the desk"
  take_description: "You lift the cup carefully"
