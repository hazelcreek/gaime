# Image Prompt: Main Engineering

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Main Engineering

Scene Description:
The heart of the ship: a vast, multi-level space dominated by the towering warp core. To the south, the corridor leads back out. To the north, a reinforced accessway toward the warp core control alcove. To the east, a corridor leads to the computer core.
The warp core rises as a column of pulsing blue light stretching floor to ceiling. Workstations ring the main floor, their LCARS displays flickering. Above, catwalks and gantries.
The air hums with barely contained power, matter and antimatter in controlled annihilation. It is both terrifying and beautiful.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Warp Core: The warp core's glow is steady — for now — but you can feel the system compensating.
- Engineering Consoles: LCARS readouts show EPS load spikes rippling outward like waves.
- Catwalks: Metal catwalks above, with conduits and access points to half the ship.
- Visible pathway behind: Back out to the engineering corridor, leading to Engineering Corridor
- Visible pathway ahead: A reinforced accessway toward the warp core control alcove, leading to Warp Core Access Alcove
- Visible pathway to the right: A corridor leading toward the ship's computer core and its isolinear pathways, leading to Computer Core (Isolinear Access)
- Engineering Toolkit sits open on a nearby console, tools neatly slotted as if awaiting your hands
- Geordi La Forge (Chief Engineer; systems expertise and practical leadership), stands at the main diagnostic console, visor angled toward the warp core's shifting light: A Starfleet engineer, moving with quick competence. He speaks to machines like colleagues and to people like teammates. Even when he’s stressed, he’s building solutions, not blame.
- Chief Miles O’Brien (Operations specialist; practical support and systems troubleshooting), moves between panels with practical speed, hands steady and unglamorous in their competence: A sturdy Starfleet officer with hands that look like they’ve fixed more problems than they’ve talked about. He’s efficient and unpretentious, the sort of person who can make a miracle look like routine maintenance.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: The interior of a Galaxy-class Federation starship, all clean curves, soft lighting, and optimistic 24th-century design. The architecture is LCARS aesthetic - rounded corners, beige and coral wall panels, with accent lighting in warm amber and blue.
The color palette centers on warm beige, rust brown, and coral, with accent colors from LCARS displays in orange, blue, and purple. Carpeting is a calm mauve, and the overall effect is more hotel than military vessel.
Materials include smooth polymer wall panels, transparent aluminum viewports, the subtle texture of carpet underfoot, and the gleaming surfaces of control consoles. Everything is immaculate and well-maintained.
Environmental details include LCARS displays on every wall, the gentle curve of corridors following the ship's saucer shape, replicator alcoves, and the ever-present stars drifting past viewports. Plants bring life to communal spaces.
Lighting is warm and diffuse, designed for long-term human comfort. The warp core pulses with blue light in Engineering, and Ten Forward glows with the light of passing stars.
Crew members wear Starfleet uniforms - command red, operations gold, sciences blue - and carry themselves with quiet competence. The ship feels like a working community, not a military installation.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Visual style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The visual style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
