# Image Prompt: Main Engineering

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Main Engineering

Scene Description:
Main Engineering feels like standing inside a controlled star. The warp core rises like a luminous pillar, blue light pulsing with restrained power. Consoles ring the space, and above, catwalks and conduits form a practical cathedral. The crew's competence is almost a kind of prayer.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene, but secured with a heavy lock or barrier
Subtle environmental details: a faint draft or subtle irregularity in the wall suggesting something hidden; a faint draft or subtle irregularity in the wall suggesting something hidden
Objects in the scene: Engineering Toolkit sits open on a nearby console, tools neatly slotted as if awaiting your hands
Characters visible in the scene:

- Geordi La Forge (Chief Engineer; systems expertise and practical leadership), stands at the main diagnostic console, visor angled toward the warp core's shifting light: A Starfleet engineer, moving with quick competence. He speaks to machines like colleagues and to people like teammates. Even when he’s stressed, he’s building solutions, not blame.

- Chief Miles O’Brien (Operations specialist; practical support and systems troubleshooting), moves between panels with practical speed, hands steady and unglamorous in their competence: A sturdy Starfleet officer with hands that look like they’ve fixed more problems than they’ve talked about. He’s efficient and unpretentious, the sort of person who can make a miracle look like routine maintenance.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Artistic style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The artistic style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
