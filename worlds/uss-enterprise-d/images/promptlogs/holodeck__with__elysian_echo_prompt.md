# Image Prompt: Holodeck 2

Edit this image to add the following character while preserving the scene exactly.

Character to add:
- The Elysian Echo (Holodeck projection exhibiting emergent awareness, shaped by an alien subspace imprint) stands just beyond the arch's projected boundary, edges flickering as if the holodeck is struggling to keep them whole; their gaze darts to the control arch with unmistakable fear: A humanoid figure rendered with holodeck precision, but unstable at the edges — as if the program is struggling to hold a life-shaped pattern inside a recreational system. Their clothing flickers between coherent forms: layered fabric, then something like environmental suit material, then back again. Their eyes catch the light with sudden, startling presence… and sometimes go distant, as if seeing a sky that is no longer there. When they move, the holodeck doesn’t merely animate; it hesitates, then commits — like a memory forcing itself into the present.

Position: stands just beyond the arch's projected boundary, edges flickering as if the holodeck is struggling to keep them whole; their gaze darts to the control arch with unmistakable fear
