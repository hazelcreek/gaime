# Image Prompt: Main Bridge

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Main Bridge

Scene Description:
The command center of the Enterprise: a spacious, circular room with warm burgundy carpet and curved walls. The turbolift doors are aft. To the east, the Ready Room door. To the west, the Observation Lounge.
The massive viewscreen dominates the forward wall, displaying a calm starfield. Workstations arc around the perimeter, their LCARS displays glowing. The captain's chair sits center, flanked by counselor seating.
The lighting is soft and even, designed to reduce eye strain. The overall impression is one of calm authority and collaborative purpose.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Viewscreen: A starfield that should be reassuring — and yet feels like a question.
- Captain's Chair: A simple seat, more symbolic than luxurious.
- Operations Console: The operations console: ship status, internal systems, and coordination.
- Tactical Station: Weapons and defensive systems — used reluctantly, but maintained flawlessly.
- Visible pathway below: The turbolift back toward the ship's decks, leading to Turbolift
- Visible pathway to the right: The Ready Room door — private, quiet, and weighty with responsibility, leading to Captain's Ready Room
- Visible pathway to the left: The Observation Lounge — where decisions gain their context, leading to Observation Lounge
- Briefing PADD rests on a side console near the aft stations, set aside for the next briefing
- Engineering Access PADD is secured near Ops with a temporary authorization tag, intended for incident response
- Commander William T. Riker (First officer; coordinates departments and delegates under pressure), leans over the central rail, posture relaxed but eyes sharp, coordinating quiet reports: Confident and relaxed even when the ship isn’t. He carries authority like a well-worn jacket: functional, familiar, never flaunted. His expression is often amused, but the eyes are sharply attentive — the kind of officer who can joke and still catch the important detail you missed.
- Lieutenant Commander Data (Operations officer; analytical support and systems coordination), stands at Ops, fingers moving with precise economy across the LCARS interface: An android officer with pale skin, attentive eyes, and an expression that is calm without being cold. His movements are precise and economical. He seems less like a machine pretending to be a person and more like a person who happens to be built differently.
- Lieutenant Worf (Security chief; protects the ship and enforces incident protocols), holds position at Tactical, rigid and vigilant, gaze scanning for threats that may not exist: A tall Klingon officer in Starfleet uniform, posture rigid with disciplined strength. His gaze is uncompromising, and his presence suggests that safety is not negotiable. Despite the severity, there is restraint — a warrior who knows the cost of violence.
- Counselor Deanna Troi (Ship’s counselor; emotional intelligence and ethical grounding), stands slightly apart, attentive to the room's emotional weather as much as the ship's: A calm presence with a warm, attentive expression. She watches people the way others watch readouts — not to judge, but to understand. When she speaks, the words feel like they make room for others to be human.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: The interior of a Galaxy-class Federation starship, all clean curves, soft lighting, and optimistic 24th-century design. The architecture is LCARS aesthetic - rounded corners, beige and coral wall panels, with accent lighting in warm amber and blue.
The color palette centers on warm beige, rust brown, and coral, with accent colors from LCARS displays in orange, blue, and purple. Carpeting is a calm mauve, and the overall effect is more hotel than military vessel.
Materials include smooth polymer wall panels, transparent aluminum viewports, the subtle texture of carpet underfoot, and the gleaming surfaces of control consoles. Everything is immaculate and well-maintained.
Environmental details include LCARS displays on every wall, the gentle curve of corridors following the ship's saucer shape, replicator alcoves, and the ever-present stars drifting past viewports. Plants bring life to communal spaces.
Lighting is warm and diffuse, designed for long-term human comfort. The warp core pulses with blue light in Engineering, and Ten Forward glows with the light of passing stars.
Crew members wear Starfleet uniforms - command red, operations gold, sciences blue - and carry themselves with quiet competence. The ship feels like a working community, not a military installation.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Visual style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The visual style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
