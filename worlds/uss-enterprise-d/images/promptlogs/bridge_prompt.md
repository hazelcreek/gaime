# Image Prompt: Main Bridge

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Main Bridge

Scene Description:
The Bridge is spacious and deliberate: carpet underfoot, gentle lighting, and stations arranged in a circle that implies collaboration rather than hierarchy. The forward viewscreen is a window into the unknown. Today it shows a calm starfield… but the faint shimmer at the edge of sensor overlays suggests the ship is not as calm as it appears.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: stairs descending, a trapdoor, or a passage leading below; a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene
Subtle environmental details: a faint draft or subtle irregularity in the wall suggesting something hidden
Objects in the scene: Briefing PADD rests on a side console near the aft stations, set aside for the next briefing; Engineering Access PADD is secured near Ops with a temporary authorization tag, intended for incident response
Characters visible in the scene:

- Commander William T. Riker (First officer; coordinates departments and delegates under pressure), leans over the central rail, posture relaxed but eyes sharp, coordinating quiet reports: Confident and relaxed even when the ship isn’t. He carries authority like a well-worn jacket: functional, familiar, never flaunted. His expression is often amused, but the eyes are sharply attentive — the kind of officer who can joke and still catch the important detail you missed.

- Lieutenant Commander Data (Operations officer; analytical support and systems coordination), stands at Ops, fingers moving with precise economy across the LCARS interface: An android officer with pale skin, attentive eyes, and an expression that is calm without being cold. His movements are precise and economical. He seems less like a machine pretending to be a person and more like a person who happens to be built differently.

- Lieutenant Worf (Security chief; protects the ship and enforces incident protocols), holds position at Tactical, rigid and vigilant, gaze scanning for threats that may not exist: A tall Klingon officer in Starfleet uniform, posture rigid with disciplined strength. His gaze is uncompromising, and his presence suggests that safety is not negotiable. Despite the severity, there is restraint — a warrior who knows the cost of violence.

- Counselor Deanna Troi (Ship’s counselor; emotional intelligence and ethical grounding), stands slightly apart, attentive to the room's emotional weather as much as the ship's: A calm presence with a warm, attentive expression. She watches people the way others watch readouts — not to judge, but to understand. When she speaks, the words feel like they make room for others to be human.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Artistic style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The artistic style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
