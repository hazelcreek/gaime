# Image Prompt: Main Bridge

Edit this image to add the following character while preserving the scene exactly.

Character to add:
- Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Commanding officer of the USS Enterprise-D) stands near the captain's chair, hands loosely clasped behind his back, watching the stars like an old friend: A composed man with a calm, deliberate presence. His uniform is immaculate, posture upright without strain. He watches more than he speaks, as if listening for the meaning beneath the words. When he does speak, the tone is measured — never loud, but difficult to ignore.

Position: stands near the captain's chair, hands loosely clasped behind his back, watching the stars like an old friend

- Maintain consistent lighting direction and shadow quality

The image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
