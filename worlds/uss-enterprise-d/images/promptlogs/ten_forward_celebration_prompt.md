Location: Ten Forward (Celebration)

Scene Description:
The same lounge, but transformed by shared relief and celebration. To the west, the main seating area of Ten Forward continues. Tables have been pushed together in a corner, laden with drinks and small plates.
Crew members cluster around the joined tables, their postures relaxed and open, smiles genuine. Someone has made a small decoration from whatever was at hand, a touch of handmade festivity.
The usual calm murmur has been replaced by animated conversation and laughter. The galaxy drifts past the windows, indifferent but somehow approving.

Scene Elements to Include:
- Celebration Table: A cluster of tables pulled together, with mugs, plates, and a few small decorations made from whatever was at hand.
- Windows: Stars curve past like slow applause.
- Visible pathway to the left: Back into the main seating area of Ten Forward, leading to Ten Forward
- Guinan (Bartender and confidante; offers perspective beyond rank), stands near the claimed table, offering warmth without making the moment about herself: Poised and observant, with a calm that feels older than the ship. She watches people the way a navigator watches a star — not because she controls them, but because she understands their trajectories. Her presence makes honesty feel possible.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: The interior of a Galaxy-class Federation starship, all clean curves, soft lighting, and optimistic 24th-century design. The architecture is LCARS aesthetic - rounded corners, beige and coral wall panels, with accent lighting in warm amber and blue.
The color palette centers on warm beige, rust brown, and coral, with accent colors from LCARS displays in orange, blue, and purple. Carpeting is a calm mauve, and the overall effect is more hotel than military vessel.
Materials include smooth polymer wall panels, transparent aluminum viewports, the subtle texture of carpet underfoot, and the gleaming surfaces of control consoles. Everything is immaculate and well-maintained.
Environmental details include LCARS displays on every wall, the gentle curve of corridors following the ship's saucer shape, replicator alcoves, and the ever-present stars drifting past viewports. Plants bring life to communal spaces.
Lighting is warm and diffuse, designed for long-term human comfort. The warp core pulses with blue light in Engineering, and Ten Forward glows with the light of passing stars.
Crew members wear Starfleet uniforms - command red, operations gold, sciences blue - and carry themselves with quiet competence. The ship feels like a working community, not a military installation.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Visual style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The visual style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
