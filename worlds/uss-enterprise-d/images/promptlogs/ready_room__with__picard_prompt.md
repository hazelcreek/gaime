# Image Prompt: Captain's Ready Room

Edit this image to add the following character while preserving the scene exactly.

Character to add:
- Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Commanding officer of the USS Enterprise-D) stands near the desk, calm as a mountain, gaze steady and curious rather than judgmental: A composed man with a calm, deliberate presence. His uniform is immaculate, posture upright without strain. He watches more than he speaks, as if listening for the meaning beneath the words. When he does speak, the tone is measured — never loud, but difficult to ignore.

Position: stands near the desk, calm as a mountain, gaze steady and curious rather than judgmental

Critical Requirements:
- PRESERVE the original scene's composition, lighting, colors, and atmosphere exactly
- MATCH the artistic style of the original image: High-quality illustration that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
- The character must be rendered in the SAME artistic style as the background
- Position the character naturally within the existing space
- Maintain consistent lighting direction and shadow quality

The image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- Any changes to the background scene
- Style inconsistencies between character and environment
