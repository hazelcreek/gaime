Location: Main Corridor (Deck 9)

Scene Description:
A wide, gently curving corridor with warm beige carpeting and walls of soft grey and burgundy. To the east, the door to cadet quarters. To the north, turbolift doors glow with a thin line of white. To the south, Ten Forward's murmur drifts.
To the west, a red medical marker indicates Sickbay. Up ahead, a branch leads toward the holodecks. A maintenance hatch is set into the deck plating below.
LCARS panels line the walls, glowing orange and blue. Crew members pass in colorful uniforms. The subtle hum of the ship's systems is ever-present.

Scene Elements to Include:
- LCARS Panels: LCARS readouts flicker — not broken, but momentarily out of sync, as if the ship is thinking too fast.
- Conduit Hum: A faint vibration runs through the bulkhead: EPS flow, a living river under the deck.
- Visible pathway to the right: The door to your cadet quarters, leading to Cadet Quarters
- Visible pathway ahead: The turbolift doors, their seams lit by a thin line of white, leading to Turbolift
- Visible pathway behind: The corridor opening toward Ten Forward with its low murmur of conversation, leading to Ten Forward
- Visible pathway to the left: A red medical marker indicating Sickbay's entrance, leading to Sickbay
- Visible pathway above: A corridor branch leading toward the holodecks, lighting subtly colder, leading to Holodeck Corridor
- Visible pathway below: A maintenance access hatch set into the deck plating
- Tricorder rests in a wall-mounted diagnostic cradle beneath a small LCARS label
- Insulated Gloves are tucked into an emergency kit compartment with a yellow hazard stripe

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Visual Setting: The interior of a Galaxy-class Federation starship, all clean curves, soft lighting, and optimistic 24th-century design. The architecture is LCARS aesthetic - rounded corners, beige and coral wall panels, with accent lighting in warm amber and blue.
The color palette centers on warm beige, rust brown, and coral, with accent colors from LCARS displays in orange, blue, and purple. Carpeting is a calm mauve, and the overall effect is more hotel than military vessel.
Materials include smooth polymer wall panels, transparent aluminum viewports, the subtle texture of carpet underfoot, and the gleaming surfaces of control consoles. Everything is immaculate and well-maintained.
Environmental details include LCARS displays on every wall, the gentle curve of corridors following the ship's saucer shape, replicator alcoves, and the ever-present stars drifting past viewports. Plants bring life to communal spaces.
Lighting is warm and diffuse, designed for long-term human comfort. The warp core pulses with blue light in Engineering, and Ten Forward glows with the light of passing stars.
Crew members wear Starfleet uniforms - command red, operations gold, sciences blue - and carry themselves with quiet competence. The ship feels like a working community, not a military installation.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Visual style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The visual style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
