# Image Prompt: Main Corridor (Deck 9)

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Main Corridor (Deck 9)

Scene Description:
A wide, softly lit corridor curves with the ship's saucer section. LCARS panels glow in warm oranges and muted reds. Crew members move with efficient calm, exchanging brief nods and clipped updates — professional, not fearful. Somewhere deeper in the ship, the ambient hum wavers like a cello string touched by an unsteady hand.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a passage or doorway visible to the right side of the scene; a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance; an opening or exit behind, perhaps suggested by light or shadows; a passage or doorway visible to the left side of the scene
Subtle environmental details: shadows on the ceiling that hint at an unseen passage; a barely visible crack in the floor or subtle depression
Objects in the scene: Tricorder rests in a wall-mounted diagnostic cradle beneath a small LCARS label; Insulated Gloves are tucked into an emergency kit compartment with a yellow hazard stripe

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Artistic style (most important): High-quality illustration that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The artistic style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
