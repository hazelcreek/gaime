# Image Prompt: Jeffries Tube Access

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Jeffries Tube Access

Scene Description:
The maintenance hatch opens onto a narrow, utilitarian tunnel — the ship's hidden anatomy. Cables and conduits run like veins. The air is warm and smells faintly of ozone. It is not glamorous work, but it is honest: the kind of place that proves ideals require infrastructure.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Visible pathways: a doorway or passage visible ahead in the distance
Subtle environmental details: shadows on the ceiling that hint at an unseen passage

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted 
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real 
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found, 
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Artistic style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The artistic style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
