# Image Prompt: Ten Forward

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Ten Forward

Scene Description:
A wide room of conversation and starlight, with the curve of the saucer's windows giving the galaxy a gentle, social intimacy. The lighting is warm. The mood is relaxed — even when the ship isn't. People come here to remember they are more than their duty rosters.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Subtle environmental details: a faint draft or subtle irregularity in the wall suggesting something hidden; a faint draft or subtle irregularity in the wall suggesting something hidden
Objects in the scene: Synthehol Coffee sits on a small table, steam rising in a familiar, human way; High-Density Data Crystal rests in a small padded case behind the bar, like a promise of careful preservation
Characters visible in the scene:

- Guinan (Bartender and confidante; offers perspective beyond rank), stands behind the bar, composed and watchful, as if she can hear decisions forming before they're spoken: Poised and observant, with a calm that feels older than the ship. She watches people the way a navigator watches a star — not because she controls them, but because she understands their trajectories. Her presence makes honesty feel possible.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Artistic style (most important): High-quality photographic image that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The artistic style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
