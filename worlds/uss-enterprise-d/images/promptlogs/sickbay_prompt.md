# Image Prompt: Sickbay

Create a dramatic, atmospheric scene illustration for a text adventure game.
This is a high-resolution production asset in 16:9 widescreen format.

Location: Sickbay

Scene Description:
Clean, bright, and quietly reassuring. The biobeds and monitors look clinical, but the human energy here is gentle: care as a discipline. The ship’s instability reaches even this far — a minor fluctuation in the lights — but Sickbay’s calm is a kind of shield.

Interactive Elements to Include:
Subtle environmental details: a faint draft or subtle irregularity in the wall suggesting something hidden
Objects in the scene: Hypospray rests on a sterilized tray beside a biobed, ready for immediate use
Characters visible in the scene:

- Dr. Beverly Crusher (Chief Medical Officer; protects crew wellbeing), stands near a biobed, eyes focused, posture simultaneously warm and formidable: A Starfleet physician with an alert, focused gaze and an unmistakable authority that comes from competence. Her calm is active — not passive — and her concern is practical, not sentimental.

Important: These elements should be integrated naturally into the scene, not highlighted
or labelled. They should reward careful observation - exits should look like real
architectural features, items should be placed where they would naturally be found,
and any characters should be positioned authentically within the space.

World Context: Star Trek: The Next Generation — life aboard a Federation starship on the frontier, philosophical, optimistic, ethical, adventurous, and grounded in teamwork under pressure

Mood: The atmosphere is optimistic, thoughtful, exploratory, calm under pressure, ethical. soft studio lighting with gentle falloff, practical set lighting, subtle rim light, minimal harsh shadows. The color palette features warm beige and soft grays, muted primaries, LCARS oranges/ambers/magentas as accents, clean whites and Federation blues.

Artistic style (most important): High-quality illustration that feels like a still frame from a late-80s/90s science-fiction television show
set aboard a Federation starship. Practical set realism: carpeted decks, smooth bulkheads, LCARS panels,
and believable starship materials (brushed metal, composite panels, glass). The image should feel calm,
composed, and human — never grimdark. The artistic style is paramount and must remain consistent across
all locations in the world.
This style must be maintained consistently throughout the entire image.

Composition: first-person perspective, medium wide shot from eye level. subtle film grain, slight diffusion/softness, gentle bloom on LCARS and starfield highlights

Critical constraints - the image must NOT include:
- cyberpunk neon dystopia
- grimdark or horror lighting
- hard industrial grime and rust
- fantasy illustration
- medieval or historical costumes
- anime or manga
- cartoon or caricature
- high-poly 3D CGI / Unreal Engine look
- modern minimalist sleek smartphone UI (Apple-store sci-fi)
- watermarks or signatures
- blurry or low-quality artifacts
- distorted proportions
- garbled readable text on screens (LCARS should be abstract, not legible words)
- extra limbs or malformed hands
- overly saturated neon colors
