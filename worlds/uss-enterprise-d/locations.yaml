cadet_quarters:
  name: Cadet Quarters
  atmosphere: |
    Compact, immaculate, and quietly personal — a Starfleet-issue cabin softened by small choices.
    Your uniform hangs perfectly aligned. A PADD rests beside a neatly folded field manual. Through
    a narrow viewport, the stars are steady and indifferent to human schedules. The ship's carpeted
    deck and gentle ambient hum make even urgency feel… civilized.
  visual_description: |
    A compact, orderly cabin with warm beige carpeting and curved walls in muted grey and burgundy. To the west, the door slides open onto the main corridor with a soft pneumatic whisper.
    A narrow viewport reveals the endless starfield outside. The built-in desk features a small LCARS panel glowing with soft orange and blue. A crisp cadet uniform hangs on the wall.
    Personal touches are minimal but meaningful: a few holo-photos, a neatly folded blanket. The space is efficient, designed for focus rather than comfort.

  atmosphere: |
    A wide, softly lit corridor curves with the ship's saucer section. LCARS panels glow in warm

    updates — professional, not fearful. Somewhere deeper in the ship, the ambient hum wavers like a
    cello string touched by an unsteady hand.

  atmosphere: |
    A clean, compact lift car lined with smooth panels and subtle illumination. The control interface

  visual_description: |
    A compact, cylindrical lift car with smooth, curved panels in warm grey and beige. To the south, the doors open back onto the corridor traffic. Up leads to the Bridge, down toward Engineering.
    A small LCARS interface glows near the door, displaying destination options in the familiar orange and blue palette. The floor is the same warm carpet as the corridors.

  atmosphere: |
    The Bridge is spacious and deliberate: carpet underfoot, gentle lighting, and stations arranged
    in a circle that implies collaboration rather than hierarchy. The forward viewscreen is a window
    into the unknown. Today it shows a calm starfield… but the faint shimmer at the edge of sensor
    overlays suggests the ship is not as calm as it appears.
  visual_description: |
    The command center of the Enterprise: a spacious, circular room with warm burgundy carpet and curved walls. The turbolift doors are aft. To the east, the Ready Room door. To the west, the Observation Lounge.
    The massive viewscreen dominates the forward wall, displaying a calm starfield. Workstations arc around the perimeter, their LCARS displays glowing. The captain's chair sits center, flanked by counselor seating.

    A private office of warm wood tones and quiet elegance. To the west, the door leads back out to the Bridge. Bookshelves line one wall, filled with real, physical books and archaeological artifacts.
    A small fish tank glows softly in a corner. The captain's desk is modest but dignified, with a small LCARS terminal and a steaming cup of Earl Grey.

  visual_description: |
    A utilitarian corridor, warmer and more industrial than the passenger decks above. The turbolift is back up. To the north, the wide doors to Main Engineering beckon.
    The walls are a functional grey with exposed conduit runs. Crew members in gold Starfleet uniforms move with purpose, consulting PADDs and exchanging technical jargon.

    The warp core rises as a column of pulsing blue light stretching floor to ceiling. Workstations ring the main floor, their LCARS displays flickering. Above, catwalks and gantries.

holodeck_corridor:
  name: Holodeck Corridor
  atmosphere: |
    The corridor outside the holodecks feels slightly different — the lighting cooler, the air more
    still. A small warning indicator is lit over one door: a polite red that suggests the ship is
    asking for permission before it panics. The faintest sound leaks through: footsteps where there
    should be none.
  visual_description: |
    A short corridor with several large, distinctive holodeck doors, their arched frames marking them as portals to simulated worlds. Down leads back to the main corridor. To the north, Holodeck 2 - if you're cleared to enter.
    One door has a small warning indicator lit in red, a quiet alarm. The lighting is slightly cooler, more neutral. The air is still, and ship sounds seem muffled.
    A faint, unidentifiable sound echoes from behind one of the doors. The corridor is empty, the usual traffic conspicuously absent.

holodeck:
  name: Holodeck 2
  atmosphere: |
    The moment you step inside, the ship's clean geometry dissolves. The holodeck projects a world
    with convincing confidence — and today that confidence has turned stubborn. The arch is present,
    but its controls lag, as if arguing. The simulation is running with a fraction too much reality:
    edges feel sharp, light feels heavy, and the air holds the charged stillness of a storm that
    hasn't decided where to break.
  visual_description: |
    The holodeck interior is a disorienting blend of projected reality and underlying grid. To the south, the exit leads back to the corridor - if the holodeck will let you leave.
    The control arch stands near the entrance, its LCARS interface lagging. The simulation flickers at the edges, revealing the yellow-and-black holographic matrix beneath.
    The projected environment feels too sharp, too real, the light too heavy. The air is charged with strange energy. The boundary between simulation and reality feels dangerously thin.

jeffries_hatch:
  name: Jeffries Tube Access
  atmosphere: |
    The maintenance hatch opens onto a narrow, utilitarian tunnel — the ship's hidden anatomy.
    Cables and conduits run like veins. The air is warm and smells faintly of ozone. It is not
    glamorous work, but it is honest: the kind of place that proves ideals require infrastructure.
  visual_description: |
    A small, utilitarian access point where a floor hatch opens onto a narrow maintenance ladder. Up leads back to the corridor and normal ship life. To the north, the Jeffries tubes stretch deeper into shadow.
    Conduits and cables run along the walls, exposed and functional. The lighting is harsher here, simple utility lights illuminating bare metal.
    The air is warm from nearby EPS conduits, the smell of ozone faint but present. Tool racks and emergency equipment are mounted on the walls.

jeffries_tube:
  name: Jeffries Tubes
  atmosphere: |
    A horizontal maintenance tube with a hexagonal cross-section, approximately one meter in diameter —
    far too narrow to stand, forcing you to crawl on hands and knees. The bare metal walls curve close
    on all sides; your shoulders nearly touch both walls at once. Metal ladder rungs are welded to the
    tube walls for climbing vertical sections. Bundles of ODN cables and EPS conduits run along the
    ceiling just above your head. Recessed utility lights every few meters cast harsh pools of white
    in an otherwise dim tunnel. Access hatches, junction boxes, and manual bypass panels are set into
    the hexagonal walls at intervals. This is a maintenance crawlspace, not a corridor — cramped,
    industrial, and claustrophobic. The bare duranium plating hums with power transfer.
  visual_description: |
    A narrow, hexagonal maintenance tube barely a meter across, forcing you to crawl on hands and knees. To the south, the access hatch leads back up. To the north, the tube stretches toward Engineering.
    The bare duranium walls curve close on all sides, claustrophobic and industrial. Bundles of ODN cables and EPS conduits run along the ceiling, some warm to the touch.
    Recessed utility lights cast harsh pools of white in the dim tunnel. Junction boxes show scorch marks - evidence of feedback surges. The hum of power transfer is tangible through the metal.
