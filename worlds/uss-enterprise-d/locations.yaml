cadet_quarters:
  name: Cadet Quarters
  atmosphere: |
    Compact, immaculate, and quietly personal — a Starfleet-issue cabin softened by small choices.
    Your uniform hangs perfectly aligned. A PADD rests beside a neatly folded field manual. Through
    a narrow viewport, the stars are steady and indifferent to human schedules. The ship's carpeted
    deck and gentle ambient hum make even urgency feel… civilized.

main_corridor:
  name: Main Corridor (Deck 9)
  atmosphere: |
    A wide, softly lit corridor curves with the ship's saucer section. LCARS panels glow in warm
    oranges and muted reds. Crew members move with efficient calm, exchanging brief nods and clipped
    updates — professional, not fearful. Somewhere deeper in the ship, the ambient hum wavers like a
    cello string touched by an unsteady hand.

        Restoring holodeck safety is physical as well as ethical: you need calm hands, proper authorization, and a plan for anything that might object.

jeffries_hatch:
  name: Jeffries Tube Access
  atmosphere: |
    The maintenance hatch opens onto a narrow, utilitarian tunnel — the ship's hidden anatomy.
    Cables and conduits run like veins. The air is warm and smells faintly of ozone. It is not
    glamorous work, but it is honest: the kind of place that proves ideals require infrastructure.

      scene_description: An EPS conduit wrapped in insulation, vibrating with too much load.
jeffries_tube:
  name: Jeffries Tubes
  atmosphere: |
    A horizontal maintenance tube with a hexagonal cross-section, approximately one meter in diameter —
    far too narrow to stand, forcing you to crawl on hands and knees. The bare metal walls curve close
    on all sides; your shoulders nearly touch both walls at once. Metal ladder rungs are welded to the
    tube walls for climbing vertical sections. Bundles of ODN cables and EPS conduits run along the
    ceiling just above your head. Recessed utility lights every few meters cast harsh pools of white
    in an otherwise dim tunnel. Access hatches, junction boxes, and manual bypass panels are set into
    the hexagonal walls at intervals. This is a maintenance crawlspace, not a corridor — cramped,
    industrial, and claustrophobic. The bare duranium plating hums with power transfer.

        A junction box with scorch marks: evidence of a brief but intense feedback surge.

        Hexagonal metal tube walls press in from all sides — you can touch both walls with your elbows while crawling.
    cables:

      scene_description: ODN cables and EPS conduits bundled overhead, close enough to bump your head on.
