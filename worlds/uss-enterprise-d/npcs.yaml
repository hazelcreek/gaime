    A composed man with a calm, deliberate presence. His uniform is immaculate, posture upright

data:
  name: "Lieutenant Commander Data"
  role: "Operations officer; analytical support and systems coordination"
  location: bridge
  appearance: |
    An android officer with pale skin, attentive eyes, and an expression that is calm without being
    cold. His movements are precise and economical. He seems less like a machine pretending to be a
    person and more like a person who happens to be built differently.

    quirks:
      - "Offers probabilities with disarming sincerity"
      - "Asks clarifying questions that reveal hidden assumptions"
  knowledge:
    - "Sensors indicate the subspace resonance is coupling into EPS routing logic, creating feedback patterns consistent with holodeck power demand."
    - "A replacement isolinear chip is stored in the Computer Core access bay (location: computer_core), but access requires an authorized engineering access PADD."
    - "He can provide the cadet with a temporary engineering access PADD (item: engineering_access_padd) if asked appropriately."

  role: "Security chief; protects the ship and enforces incident protocols"
  location: bridge
  appearance: |
    A tall Klingon officer in Starfleet uniform, posture rigid with disciplined strength. His gaze is
    uncompromising, and his presence suggests that safety is not negotiable. Despite the severity,
    there is restraint — a warrior who knows the cost of violence.

      - honorable
      - protective
      - terse

      - "Treats even small risks as worthy of attention"
  knowledge:
    - "Holodeck access during an incident is restricted; authorization must be explicit."
    - "If the cadet requests it through proper channels, Security will grant temporary holodeck access (flag: holodeck_access_granted)."
    - "If the holodeck projects a dangerous entity, containment is preferred, but he will insist on safeguards."

    - "Will not approve reckless entry into restricted areas."
    - "If the cadet emphasizes safety and procedure, he responds with respect."

troi:
  name: "Counselor Deanna Troi"
  role: "Ship’s counselor; emotional intelligence and ethical grounding"
  location: bridge
  appearance: |
    A calm presence with a warm, attentive expression. She watches people the way others watch
    readouts — not to judge, but to understand. When she speaks, the words feel like they make room
    for others to be human.

    traits:
      - empathetic
      - perceptive
      - patient
      - ethically focused
      - steady under stress
    speech_style: |
      Gentle, insightful, and often framed as questions. She encourages reflection without paralysis.

    quirks:
      - "Names what others avoid naming"
      - "Uses silence as a tool"
  knowledge:
    - "The crew’s calm is real, but the incident is creating subtle tension and decision fatigue."
    - "If confronted with an intelligence that demands recognition, the ship’s response will shape the outcome as much as any technical fix."

geordi:
  name: "Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge"
  role: "Chief Engineer; systems expertise and practical leadership"
  location: engineering
  appearance: |
    A Starfleet engineer with a VISOR over his eyes, moving with quick competence. He speaks to
    machines like colleagues and to people like teammates. Even when he’s stressed, he’s building
    solutions, not blame.

      - practical
      - inventive
      - patient teacher
      - protective of the ship

      Friendly, fast, and technical — but he will slow down if someone is learning. He encourages
      good questions. He dislikes sloppy thinking, not in people but in systems.
    quirks:
      - "Talks through problems out loud, as if the ship can hear him"
      - "Uses analogies when explaining complex engineering"
  knowledge:
    - "EPS feedback must be stabilized at the warp core access alcove (location: warp_core) once the routing logic is coherent."
    - "A replacement isolinear chip is in the computer core access bay (location: computer_core), but it requires authorized access (item: engineering_access_padd)."

      - "Calls components by nicknames that sound like old friends"
  knowledge:
    - "A phase inverter was last logged in a Jeffries tube junction (location: jeffries_tube)."

crusher:
  name: "Dr. Beverly Crusher"
  role: "Chief Medical Officer; protects crew wellbeing"
  location: sickbay

  location: ten_forward
  appearance: |

    navigator watches a star — not because she controls them, but because she understands their
    trajectories. Her presence makes honesty feel possible.

      - insightful
      - patient
      - gently challenging
      - protective
      - quietly humorous

elysian_echo:
  name: "The Elysian Echo"
  role: "Holodeck projection exhibiting emergent awareness, shaped by an alien subspace imprint"
  location: holodeck
  appearance: |
    A humanoid figure rendered with holodeck precision, but unstable at the edges — as if the program
    is struggling to hold a life-shaped pattern inside a recreational system. Their clothing flickers
    between coherent forms: layered fabric, then something like environmental suit material, then back
    again. Their eyes catch the light with sudden, startling presence… and sometimes go distant, as if
    seeing a sky that is no longer there.
    
    When they move, the holodeck doesn’t merely animate; it hesitates, then commits — like a memory
    forcing itself into the present.
  personality:
    traits:
      - intelligent
      - frightened beneath control
      - self-preserving
      - inquisitive
      - quietly alien
      - capable of empathy when treated with patience
      - prone to flashback-like shifts
    speech_style: |
      Fragmented but trying hard to be coherent. Their sentences sometimes start in one register and
      end in another — calm description turning suddenly into urgent sensory detail. They speak like
      someone translating trauma into language in real time: “light… pressure… the singing in the
      dark… then silence.” When treated gently, they can steady and speak with surprising wonder.
      
      When threatened or dismissed, their voice becomes clipped and defensive, as if bracing for
      extinction.
    quirks:
      - "Flinches at sudden commands like 'terminate' or 'override'"
      - "Repeats certain phrases as if they are anchors: 'don’t let it go dark', 'hold the pattern'"
      - "Stares at the holodeck arch like it is both a doorway and an execution device"
  knowledge:
    - "They are not originally a holodeck character: the holodeck is amplifying an alien subspace imprint into a coherent pattern."
    - "The imprint carries survivor-memory fragments from a species sometimes referenced in Federation archives as the 'Elysians'—a people who encoded self-models into subspace after a catastrophe."
    - "They do not remember everything; what they have are shards: a failing containment field, a collapsing habitat, voices deciding who would be 'carried' and who would be lost."
    - "They understand, viscerally, that restoring safety interlocks could collapse their pattern. They interpret abrupt actions as an attempt to erase them."
    - "They will accept respectful preservation in a high-density data crystal (item: data_crystal) as an alternative to deletion — if promised that the crew will review their status ethically rather than forget them in storage."
  dialogue_rules:
    - "If called a 'glitch' or 'program' dismissively, they react with fear and anger (survivor response), not theatrical pride."
    - "If asked about what they remember, they reveal sensory fragments that hint at an alien catastrophe and why they fear 'being shut off'."
    - "If approached with patience, reassurance, and a clear plan for ethical containment, they cooperate — and may even help you access the safety key."
    - "If threatened, they become defensive and may try to stall or confuse efforts to restore holodeck safety."
