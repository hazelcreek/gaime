premise: |
  You are a Starfleet cadet on your very first assignment aboard the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D).
  Officially, you are here to observe and learn. Unofficially, you are about to learn how fast
  theory becomes practice when the ship faces an unexpected problem.
  
  The Enterprise is not just metal and forcefields — it is a community that tries to be worthy of
  its own ideals. Out here, those ideals will be tested.
  
  You grew up on a quiet Federation outpost where “the frontier” meant long-range sensor pings and
  supply ships that arrived late more often than on time. You joined Starfleet for the same reason
  most people do when they’re honest: to find out what kind of person you become when the universe
  doesn’t give you the answer in advance.

# IMPORTANT: Explain WHY the player can act NOW
starting_situation: |
  Your first shift aboard the Enterprise has barely begun when the ship’s lights subtly flicker and
  the gentle hum of the warp core deepens by half a note. A calm computer voice announces an
  “unusual subspace resonance” and recommends diagnostic teams to report. Around you, the crew
  moves with practiced purpose — no panic, no theatrics — but the ship is clearly not running as
  she should.
  
  Your combadge chirps. You are being called to assist with a problem that the senior staff is
  already dividing between departments. You have a narrow window to help stabilize the situation
  before it spreads from an inconvenience into a danger.

  location: ten_forward_celebration
  flag: anomaly_resolved
  narrative: |
    Ten Forward is brighter than it was earlier — or maybe the ship’s hum is simply steady again,
    making everything feel easier to breathe. The windows curve the stars into a slow, elegant drift,
    and for the first time since your combadge chirped, you can feel the crew’s tension drain away.
    
    Someone has commandeered a corner table. There are mugs of synthehol coffee and plates of
    replicated food arranged with informal ceremony. Laughter arrives in small bursts — not relief
    at surviving, but satisfaction at doing the job the right way.
    
    Commander Riker raises a glass in your direction, not loudly, but where you can’t pretend you
    didn’t see it. “To the newest member of the team,” he says, and the table answers in chorus.
    
    Guinan’s smile is subtle and knowing. “Looks like you chose the hard option,” she says quietly,
    “and lived with it.”
    
    Captain Picard appears only briefly — long enough to offer a nod that feels like a medal without
    the weight of metal. “Well done, Cadet,” he says. “You handled uncertainty with discipline — and
    compassion.”
    
    For a moment, the Enterprise feels exactly like what you imagined when you first applied to the
    Academy: not a weapon, not a machine, but a place where people decide to be better together.
    
    CONGRATULATIONS — You completed your first mission aboard the Enterprise-D.

player:
  starting_location: cadet_quarters
  starting_inventory:
    - combadge
    - cadet_padd
    - starfleet_field_manual
    - academy_commencement_pin
    - family_holochip

constraints:
  - "This world is set aboard the USS Enterprise-D and should feel like Star Trek: TNG: optimistic, ethical, competent, and team-oriented."
  - "The player is a cadet: capable, curious, but not omniscient; senior officers guide and delegate but do not do everything for the player."
  - "Violence is not the default solution. Phaser use (if any) is stun-only and must be justified; diplomacy, analysis, and teamwork are preferred."
  - "The holodeck malfunction cannot be resolved by simply 'turning it off' until safety interlocks are restored and feedback is contained."
  - "Access to sensitive areas (warp core access, computer core access) must require explicit authorization from the appropriate officer."
  - "The anomaly_resolved flag must ONLY be set after: EPS feedback is stabilized, holodeck safety is restored, and an ethical resolution is chosen for any emergent holographic intelligence."
  - "The ethical resolution for the Elysian Echo should be dignified and Starfleet-consistent: do not delete or 'terminate' a potentially sapient pattern if secure containment (e.g., the data_crystal) is available."
  - "Do not allow 'ethical_resolution_complete' to be set unless the player has secured the data_crystal and has clearly offered respectful containment and future review."
  - "Items must be in the player's inventory to be used conceptually, and the game master must not invent new tools or off-screen fixes."
  - "Starfleet principles matter: when faced with a sentient or potentially sentient being, the crew must pursue containment and dignity over destruction when feasible."
