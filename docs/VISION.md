## Vision Discovery Guide

Use this section to run a future session to flesh out the vision above.

### How to Run a Vision Discovery Session

Start a new Cursor session and say:

> "Let's flesh out the GAIME vision. Interview me to understand what I want GAIME to be."

The AI should ask questions like:

**Product Vision Questions:**
1. When someone finishes playing a GAIME adventure, what do you want them to feel?
2. Describe your ideal player - who are they and what do they enjoy?
3. What's the one thing GAIME does that nothing else does?
4. If GAIME is wildly successful in 2 years, what does that look like?

**Technical Vision Questions:**
1. What trade-offs are you willing to make? (e.g., simplicity vs features, speed vs quality)
2. What technical decisions should be "set in stone" vs "flexible"?
3. How important is extensibility vs getting things working?
4. What's your philosophy on AI involvement - where should it help vs stay out?

**Storytelling & Game Design Questions:**
1. What role should puzzles play in the experience?
2. How linear vs open should adventures be?
3. What's the balance between authored content and AI generation?
4. How important is replayability?

After the session, update this document with the answers.
