# GAIME Feature Ideas & Roadmap

This document tracks potential features and enhancements for the GAIME text adventure engine.

**Status Legend:**
- `[ ]` Proposed - idea captured, not yet started
- `[~]` In Progress - actively being developed
- `[x]` Completed - implemented and merged

---

## Narrative & Immersion

### Player Character Backstory System
`[ ]` **Proposed**

The main character should have a rich background story defined during world building to increase immersion. This backstory can be:
- Slowly revealed through NPC dialogues during gameplay
- Used to motivate specific skills or abilities the player has
- Referenced by NPCs who have history with the character
- Unlocked through interactive flashback sequences

### Environmental Storytelling
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Subtle details in location descriptions that reveal world history and lore when examined closely. Objects and environments tell stories without explicit exposition.

### Emotional State Tracking
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Track the player character's emotional state (fear, confidence, anger, etc.) which affects:
- Narration style and tone
- Available dialogue options
- How NPCs perceive and react to the player

### Consequences & Ripple Effects
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Actions have delayed consequences that surface later in the game. Helping someone early might lead to unexpected aid later; being rude might close off opportunities.

### Multiple Endings / Branching Paths
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Different outcomes based on cumulative choices and actions throughout the game. Major decisions create meaningful divergence in the story.

### Narrative Recap on Resume
`[ ]` **Proposed**

"Previously on..." style summary when returning to a saved game, helping players remember context and recent events.

### Interactive Flashbacks
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Playable memory sequences tied to the player's backstory that unlock as the game progresses, revealing character history through gameplay.

## Audio & Visual

### Audio Narration
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Text-to-speech narration of game narrative, with configurable voice settings and the ability to toggle on/off.

### Background Music
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Ambient music that matches the current location's atmosphere and adapts to game events (tension during danger, calm during exploration).

### Sound Effects
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Audio feedback for actions, environmental sounds, and atmospheric effects to enhance immersion.

### Varied Storytelling Tone
`[ ]` **Proposed**

More variation in the tone of narration - serious, humorous, mysterious, etc. - configurable per world or adapting to game events.

### Visual Style Variation
`[ ]` **Proposed**

More variety in image generation styles - different art styles, color palettes, and visual treatments that can be configured per world or location.

---

## World State & Dynamics

### Extensive World State Management
`[ ]` **Proposed**

NPCs and environments respond to game events:
- NPCs behave differently after certain actions or events
- Locations change based on player actions
- World state persists and evolves throughout gameplay

### Dynamic Time & Weather System
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Time of day and weather conditions that affect:
- Atmosphere and location descriptions
- NPC availability (some appear only at certain times)
- Available actions (weather affects outdoor activities)

### Ambient Events
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Periodic atmospheric descriptions and minor events that make the world feel alive without requiring player action.

---

## NPCs & Dialogue

### Dialog Mode with NPCs
`[ ]` **Proposed**

A dedicated conversation mode where players can:
- Type questions directly to NPCs
- Have multi-turn conversations
- Affect game progress through dialogue choices

### Smarter NPC Behavior
`[ ]` **Proposed**

NPCs with improved intelligence:
- Behave appropriately based on whether they know the player character
- Remember previous interactions
- Respond less repetitively with more varied dialogue
- Have moods and attitudes that affect conversations

### Reputation & Relationship System
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Track how NPCs feel about the player based on interactions:
- Affects dialogue options and NPC cooperation
- Can open or close questlines and information access
- NPCs may gossip, affecting relationships with others

---

## Items & Discovery

### Sophisticated Item Discovery
`[ ]` **Proposed**

More varied ways to find items:
- Some items are visible and obvious in room descriptions
- Some items are hidden and require specific actions (open drawer, look under bed)
- Environmental clues hint at hidden items
- Discovering items can involve multi-step processes

### Inventory Examination Depth
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Detailed examination of items reveals:
- Additional information and lore
- Hidden features or compartments
- Clues and hints for puzzles
- Connections to the player's backstory

---

## UI & Player Experience

### Player Journal / Notes
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Automatic or manual recording of:
- Important discoveries and clues
- NPC information and conversation summaries
- Key events and locations visited
- Player notes and reminders

### Adaptive Hint System
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Contextual hints that appear if the player seems stuck:
- Subtle enough to not break immersion
- Escalating from vague to more specific if needed
- Can be toggled off for hardcore players

---

## Developer Tools

### Debug Mode
`[ ]` **Proposed**

Comprehensive debugging capabilities for:
- **Gameplay**: View game state, teleport, spawn items, trigger events
- **World Building**: Validate world files, preview content, test connections
- **Image Generation**: Preview prompts, regenerate images, test styles

---

## Future Considerations

Ideas that need more exploration before becoming concrete features:

- **Multiplayer / Shared Worlds** - Multiple players in the same world
- **Modding Support** - Community-created worlds with easy sharing
- **Mobile App** - Native mobile experience
- **Voice Input** - Speak commands instead of typing
- **AI Dungeon Master Personality** - Configurable narrator personalities
- **Procedural World Generation** - AI-generated worlds from simple prompts
- **Achievement System** - Track milestones and accomplishments
- **Accessibility Features** - Screen reader support, colorblind modes, font scaling
